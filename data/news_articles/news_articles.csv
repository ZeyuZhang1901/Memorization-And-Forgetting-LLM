1,tapestry capri ftc merger would said federal order injunction decision,"A federal judge blocked Tapestry's acquisition of Capri on Thursday following a brief trial last month in New York.

In her order, Judge Jennifer Rochon granted the Federal Trade Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction to block the proposed merger, which would marry America's two largest luxury houses and put six fashion brands under one company: Tapestry's Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman with Capri's Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors.

Tapestry's stock surged 10% after the order was filed while Capri's plunged about 50%.

In a statement, Tapestry said it plans to appeal the order, ""consistent with our obligations under the merger agreement.""

""Today's decision granting the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction is disappointing and, we believe, incorrect on the law and the facts. Tapestry and Capri operate in an industry that is intensely competitive and dynamic, constantly expanding, and highly fragmented among both established players and new entrants,"" the company said. ""We face competitive pressures from both lower- and higher-priced products and continue to believe this transaction is pro-competitive and pro-consumer.""

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Tapestry agreed to reimburse Capri for expenses incurred in connection with the transaction if it fails to be approved, according to a securities filing. If either Tapestry or Capri walks away from the deal because it didn't receive regulatory approval or, a government issued a permanent, non-appealable injunction against it, Tapestry agreed to pay Capri between $30 million and $50 million, the filing said.

Capri, on the other hand, has agreed to pay a breakup fee of $240 million if it decides to terminate the proposed merger.

Rochon's reasoning behind the order wasn't immediately clear. A detailed opinion was filed under seal and isn't currently accessible to the public.

The former rivals and longtime competitors announced the $8.5 billion deal more than a year ago but the Federal Trade Commission sued to block it in April and sought a preliminary injunction to stop the agreement.

The FTC argued if the companies merged, it would harm consumers by making the affordable handbag market less accessible and would leave employees with worse salaries and benefits. Tapestry argued consumers would be better off if it merged with Capri because it would allow them to keep up with trends faster, offer better products and reach more customers.

""Today's decision is a victory not only for the FTC, but also for consumers across the country seeking access to quality handbags at affordable prices,"" Henry Liu, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. ""These bags are a product which millions of people rely on throughout their daily lives. The decision will ensure that Tapestry and Capri continue to engage in head-to-head competition to the benefit of the American public.""

The decision comes at a time when consumers are more price-sensitive than ever after years of elevated inflation. The Biden administration, and Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris, have pushed for the federal government to use its power to maintain competition and help keep prices low. Republican candidate Donald Trump has also criticized inflation and has pushed for tariffs to address the issue.

The FTC under Chair Lina Khan has moved to block mergers and acquisitions in the grocery, technology and apparel spaces.

During the trial last month, key witnesses called by the FTC cited research that showed the merger could raise prices for handbags, accessories and apparel, and may give the combined company little incentive to invest in product quality.

Lawyers for Tapestry and Capri argued the companies are not each other's main competitors. They said shoppers now have more options than ever in the handbag market, and trends can change in a blink in the era of TikTok.

2,tesla billion quarter earnings higher year said growth expected q3,"Tesla stock (TSLA) surged on Thursday after investors focused on the positive from mixed third quarter earnings results.

Investors cheered beats on adjusted earnings per share and higher gross margins in addition to the news that Tesla's cheaper electric vehicle is on track for production next year. CEO Elon Musk also said on an earnings call that Tesla's volume growth could be 20%-30% next year.

Tesla shares ended nearly 22% higher, adding tens of billions of dollars to the company's market valuation in its best day since 2013.

• USD (TSLA) View Quote Details

Tesla reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which was lower than the $25.4 billion expected per Bloomberg consensus but higher than the $25.05 billion it reported in Q2 and also topped the $23.4 billion Tesla reported a year ago. Tesla posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 vs. $0.60 expected, on adjusted net income of $2.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9 billion.

The closely watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.

""We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes,"" the company said in its earnings deck. ""Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles — including more affordable models — which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025.""

Earlier this month, Tesla announced third quarter deliveries that slightly missed expectations, sending the stock lower.

Tesla said it delivered 462,890 vehicles in Q3, up 6.4% quarter over quarter, to mark the first quarter of delivery growth this year. The numbers also came in ahead of the 435,059 EVs the company delivered in the year-ago period. But Wall Street had expected Tesla to deliver closer to 463,897, according to Bloomberg.

""Refreshed Model 3 ramp continued successfully in Q3 with higher total production and lower cost of goods sold quarter-over-quarter. Cybertruck production increased sequentially and achieved a positive gross margin for the first time,"" Tesla said in its report.

Tesla said it expects vehicle deliveries to achieve ""slight growth"" in 2024. CEO Elon Musk added during the conference call that 20%-30% growth next year is possible, though he couched it as a ""best guess.""

Ahead of Tesla's Q3 disclosure, shares were down approximately 11% since Tesla revealed its robotaxi, dubbed the Cybercab, at its showy “We, Robot” event at the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank, Calif., on Oct. 10.

Investors and analysts were left wanting more details from Tesla’s “We, Robot” event on the Cybercab itself and detailed testing plans, along with questions about the development of Tesla’s sub-$30,000 EV, dubbed the Model 2.

3,costco membership scanners front counts customers netflix card stores paying,"Costco’s introduction of membership card scanners at the front of US stores is still rolling out, but the move is already paying off big for the wholesale club.

Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note this week that Costco warehouses are seeing as much as low double-digit increases in membership counts after implementing the scanners, and suggested the high conversion rates of previously non-paying customers could lead to the retailer’s “Netflix moment.”

The report, led by Simeon Gutman, acknowledged that Costco and Netflix have two very different business models, but suggested the warehouse club’s new tool for checking memberships could lead to the kind of growth in paying customers that the streaming giant saw after it cracked down on password sharing.

Since limiting password-sharing last year, Netflix has seen a significant surge in new accounts.

In the first quarter of 2024 alone, the streaming company added 9.3 million sign-ups – a five-fold increase compared to the same quarter in 2023.

“Our base scenario suggests Costco could capture an additional 4 million members through conversion of nonfee paying customers in North America,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

During Costco’s fourth quarter earnings call last month, CEO Ron Vachris noted that the company has used card readers at the front of its stores in Europe for more than two years now and has been piloting the system in the US for roughly six months.

He pointed to several ways the scanners help Costco improve operational efficiency at stores.

“It gives our operators real-time traffic counts throughout the day. So, we’re able to adjust front-end lines that we need to open and close lines based on the fluctuations of business,” Vachris explained.

“We can monitor our fresh foods a little better because we know what the traffic counts look like and so forth,” he said, “and it has also taken the friction of membership verification away from the front-end registers and moved that to the front door, where we’re able to look at people’s membership status.”

The Costco chief added that the scanners also allow customers to be notified if their membership renewals are due before they reach the front end of the store, “and the membership card scanners installed at the front doors have delivered on the goal of speeding up the checkout process.

“This has been very well received by our members.”",437,"card, costco, moment, membership, netflix, counts, stanley, membershipboosting, paying, scanners, customers, quarter"
4,tesla musk car said wheel idea company steering pedals robotaxi,"The idea of a $25,000 Tesla has persisted for years — in part, perhaps, because CEO Elon Musk said he was “very confident” the company could do it at an event in 2020.

But on Wednesday night, during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the idea of a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals is “pointless,” and “silly.” He said he only wants to sell one car at that price: the “Cybercab” robotaxi he revealed a prototype of two weeks ago.

It was the latest in a long line of public and private flip-flopping from Musk, a process that has so muddied the waters about Tesla’s future product portfolio that some of his company’s most ardent supporters have confidently and wrongly proclaimed that the idea of a drivable $25,000 Tesla — with a steering wheel and pedals — never existed.

But it did. Here’s how we got here.

Battery Day

Musk surfaced the idea of a $25,000 Tesla in 2020 at the company’s so-called “Battery Day” event. It was a showcase of the new in-house battery cells Tesla was working on, which were larger and more energy dense. Those advancements were supposed to help drive down the cost of the most expensive piece of any EV, the battery pack. And they would enable Tesla to sell a car for $25,000, Musk said.

“I think probably three years from now we’re confident we can make a very compelling $25,000 electric vehicle, that’s also fully autonomous,” he said.

You could take that one of two ways. Either he meant the car would be a robotaxi like the Cybercab, with no steering wheel or pedals. Or he was talking about a car with a wheel and pedals that, like he has promised about all other Teslas, would one day receive a software update that made it autonomous. For what it’s worth, Musk reportedly was unsure about whether it would or wouldn’t be manually drivable in a September 2021 meeting.

But it’s not worth spending time arguing what exactly Musk meant. Because his own biographer found out.

Two cars

Musk announced in January 2022 that Tesla was “not currently working on the $25,000 car,” saying at the time that Tesla still planned to do it, but that the company had too much on its plate. He also said that making Tesla’s cars autonomous was more important than designing a car for that price point.

Musk’s biographer, Walter Isaacson, found out what happened next. In his biography, Isaacson describes that Musk and his top lieutenants spent months hashing out whether to pursue the robotaxi idea, or a more traditional car.

Isaacson describes Tesla’s chief designer Franz von Holzhausen trying to convince Musk in an August 2022 meeting that making a car with no steering wheel or pedals was risky if the company couldn’t get its Full Self-Driving software ready in time.

“He suggested that they make a car that had a steering wheel and pedals that could be easily removed,” Isaacson wrote of von Holzhausen’s pitch. Here’s what followed:

“No,” Musk said. “No. NO.” There was a long pause. “No mirrors, no pedals, no steering wheel. This is me taking responsibility for this decision.”



The executives sitting around the table hesitated. “Uh, we will come back to you on that,” one said.



Musk got into one of his very cold moods. “Let me be clear,” he said slowly. “This vehicle must be designed as a clean Robotaxi. We’re going to take that risk. It’s my fault if it f—s up. But we are not going to design some sort of amphibian frog that’s a halfway car. We are all in on autonomy.”



But von Holzhausen and Tesla engineering VP Lars Moravy did not drop the idea of a manually drivable car — if only because they saw it as a hedge to the risk that Tesla would either be slow to get the software right, or that it would run into regulatory red tape.

So they kept working on the more traditional design in secret.

In September 2022, according to Isaacson, von Holzhausen and Moravy convinced Musk that the right approach was to develop both vehicles. Musk was initially not thrilled, as Isaacson tells it. But by February 2023, when von Holzhausen showed Musk models of “the Robotaxi and the $25,000 car next to each other in the studio,” Musk “loved the designs.”

“The new mass-market vehicle, both with a steering wheel and as a Robotaxi, became known as ‘the next generation platform,’” Isaacson wrote.

The report

The idea that Tesla was building two different vehicles on this next-generation platform held for about a year, until Reuters published a bombshell story in April 2024: Tesla had scrapped plans to build a manually operable $25,000 car in favor of just pursuing the robotaxi.

It appeared Musk had flipped again. In response, he claimed — without offering proof — that Reuters was “lying.” But a few weeks later when Tesla released its quarterly results, the company tacitly admitted the report was right.

Tesla confirmed in that quarter’s shareholder letter that it was still pursuing a robotaxi design. But it also said it was working on “new vehicles, including more affordable models” that would “utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.” This is a very different plan from the $25,000 car that Musk approved in February 2023, according to Isaacson.

To this day, the company has not explained what these new models will look like. Some have speculated that Tesla is developing even-more-pared-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y. What seems clear from subsequent earnings releases is that Tesla is accomplishing those further cost reductions by using ideas from the next-generation platform — ideas that were meant for the $25,000 car that was going to be built on that platform — and building them on existing production lines.

How low is Tesla trying to go with those cost reductions? The company hasn’t said, and it no longer has a public relations department. The Model 3 currently starts at around $42,000. Musk now says a $25,000 car is “silly” and “pointless.” Maybe finally delivering a car at the long-promised $35,000 price tag that the Model 3 was supposed to sell at is a more serious idea.

Whatever the answer winds up being, just remember this the next time anyone questions it: Tesla really was at one point working on a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals.",1098,"idea, teslas, isaacson, 25000, wheel, flipflop, car, pedals, explained, ev, robotaxi, steering, tesla, musk"

Amazon announced Wednesday that Prime members can now now save $0.10 per gallon at approximately 7,000 BP-affiliated (BP+0.69% ) gas stations across the country, including Amoco and Ampm.

For the average U.S. driver, this could translate to nearly $70 in annual savings, according to Amazon. Amazon Prime memberships start at $14.99 a month or $139 a year.

“We’re always asking ourselves how Prime can save members more money, and fuel savings is our latest offer that puts money back into members’ wallets,” the e-commerce giant said in a blog post announcing the perk.

Amazon added that it plans to expand these transportation-related savings to EV drivers in 2025, with an EV charging savings offer at BP pulse, which is BP’s electric vehicle charging business.

How does it work?

To unlock $0.10 off per gallon, Prime members will need an account with Earnify, a gas loyalty program from BP. Subscribers then must visit a page set up by Amazon to activate the offer and link their Amazon account with Earnify.

Members can use the Earnify app’s store locator to find nearby BP, Amoco, or Ampm gas stations. To redeem the offer, members must enter their phone number or linked payment method at the pump. Or, they can use the Earnify app to select the station and pump.

Behind the deal

BP and Amazon started working together publicly at the end of 2019. At the time, BP said it would supply renewable energy to Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers in Europe, while Amazon said BP would migrate data to AWS. In each announcement, the companies cited BP’s environmental efforts.

Yet, Reuters reported earlier this month that BP has cast aside its pledge to lower its oil and gas output by 2030.

Other tech and energy giants have recently scaled back some of their own environmental promises, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Google.

6,boeing spirit furloughs machinists strike said weighing spokesman week wednesday,"Spirit AeroSystems is weighing furloughs or layoffs of hundreds more employees if the Boeing machinists' strike stretches beyond Nov. 25, a company spokesman told CNBC on Thursday.

Boeing's machinists, whose strike is about to enter its sixth week, voted 64% against a newly proposed labor contract on Wednesday, extending the work stoppage that has halted production of most of Boeing's aircraft, which is centered in the Seattle area.

Spirit, which makes fuselages for Boeing's best-selling 737 Max as well as other major parts, had already been preparing to temporarily furlough about 700 workers in its Wichita, Kansas, facilities. Those 21-day furloughs could begin next week.

Further reductions would be in addition to those furloughs, but no decision has been made, said Spirit spokesman Joe Buccino.

Spirit's consideration of additional furloughs demonstrates how the lengthy strike is weighing on an already-fragile aerospace supply chain. Boeing suppliers have largely hesitated to cut staff in part because they had spent years rebuilding their workforces in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Airbus is also facing similar supply chain pressure.

More than 32,000 Boeing machinists in the Puget Sound area, Oregon and other locations walked off the job on Sept. 13 after turning down an earlier tentative agreement.

Boeing is in the process of acquiring Spirit, a deal it expects to close next year. Spirit has been burning through cash and, on Wednesday, reported a third-quarter net loss of $477 million, more than double a year earlier.

Boeing's new CEO Kelly Ortberg has said getting a deal with its Seattle-area machinists and ending the strike is a top priority, and the workers' union has said it is eager to get back to the negotiating table.",281,"furloughs, deal, weighing, supply, strike, layoffs, hundreds, spokesman, workers, boeing, machinists, weighs, goes, aerosystems, nov, spirit"
7,mcdonald said quarter onions lawsuit coli food outbreak colorado filed,"New York CNN —

A Colorado man has filed the first lawsuit against McDonald’s relating to its E. coli outbreak linked to Quarter Pounders that, so far, has led to at least 49 illnesses across 10 states, including one death.

The lawsuit was filed one day after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a food safety alert warning that dozens of people reported eating the Quarter Pounder sandwich at McDonald’s before becoming sick.

Eric Stelly purchased food from a McDonald’s location in Greeley, Colorado three weeks ago and began experiencing several gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, cramps and bloody stools, which his lawyer notes is the most “common symptom” of E. coli, according to a press release from Ron Simon, the lawyer for the plaintiff.

After a few days later of continuing pain, he went to the emergency room of a local hospital and tested positive for E. coli. Stelly is still recovering from the sickness, the release says.

The lawsuit, a copy of which was posted online by Bloomberg Law, accuses McDonald’s of product liability, negligence and breach of implied warranties. It was filed Wednesday in a Cook County, Illinois court, where Chicago-based McDonald’s is headquartered.

A specific ingredient has not been confirmed as the source of the outbreak, but the US Food and Drug Administration says that the slivered onions or beef patties on Quarter Pounder sandwiches are the likely source of contamination.

McDonald’s didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about the lawsuit.

On Wednesday, McDonald’s USA President Joe Erlinger said on NBC’s “Today” that it’s safe to eat at McDonald’s and that affected ingredients are probably out of the supply chain at restaurants.

“We are very confident that you can go to McDonald’s and enjoy our classics” without getting sick, he said.

“If there has been contaminated product within our supply chain, it’s very likely worked itself through that supply chain already,” but he acknowledged that the number of illnesses reported may rise as the CDC investigates and traces cases.

“Serving customers safely in every single restaurant, each and every day, is our top priority,” McDonald’s said in a statement Tuesday.

Simon, which describes his office as a national food safety law firm, is also representing at least 10 other “victims in the outbreak” in addition to Stelly, according to the release.

“The McDonald’s E. coli Outbreak will be one of the most significant food poisoning outbreaks this year,” Simon said in a press release. “Through this lawsuit and others, we will make sure that all of the victims are fully compensated for their losses, that their voices are heard, and that McDonald’s and its suppliers permanently fix the health violations that caused the food to become contaminated with E. coli.”

Also on Thursday, a second lawsuit was filed by the same lawyer on behalf of Clarissa DeBock, a Nebraska resident who ate at a McDonald’s in September and later was diagnosed with E. coli, according to a complaint by the law firm. She’s still recovering from her symptoms, the complaint said.

Quarter Pounder problems

McDonald’s has taken Quarter Pounders off the menu in about a fifth of its stores. The company has stopped using the onions as well as quarter-pound beef patties in several states, including Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming, as well as portions of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The investigation continues, the CDC said.

The beef patties are used only for the Quarter Pounders, and the slivered onions are used primarily for the Quarter Pounder and not other items, according to the CDC. Diced onions and other types of beef patties used at McDonald’s have not been implicated in this outbreak, the FDA said.

McDonald’s supplier Taylor Farms Colorado says it is working closely with the FDA and CDC. It says it has removed yellow onions from the market “out of an abundance of caution,” the company said Wednesday.

A Taylor Farms spokesperson said it has found no traces of E. coli in tests of raw or finished onions. “We have never seen E. coliO157:H7 associated with onions in the past,” the statement said.",690,"pounder, filed, food, outbreak, onions, patties, lawsuit, mcdonalds, coli, quarter"
8,quarter market morning brief moving billion investors servicenow third open,"On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Madison Mills and Seana Smith analyze the market open and break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led stock gains Thursday morning, moving as high as 0.6% at the market open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped by nearly 0.3% at the start of the trading day.

Tesla (TSLA) added about $80 billion to its market cap after beating earnings-per-share estimates and announcing it expects to roll out autonomous ride-hailing in California and Texas in 2025. Wedbush Securities Managing Director & Senior Equity Analyst Dan Ives tells Morning Brief that margins were crucial this quarter: ""That's been a huge part of the overhang on this story. They beat by 200 bps (basis points). Price cuts in the rearview mirror. And when you combine that with that growth forecast, I think whisper numbers called 10, 11%. They gave 20 and 30%. It's an Aaron Judge-like quarter,"" Ives states.

As investors now await the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" earnings, Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, explains that there is a greater emphasis on the tech sector given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters.""

ServiceNow (NOW) delivered robust third quarter earnings, exceeding expectations on both revenue and profit. Additionally, the cloud-computing platform raised its subscription revenue guidance. ServiceNow CFO Gina Mastantuono attributes ServiceNow's third quarter success to the company's achievements in generative AI, particularly its Now Assist feature. She calls it ""the fastest growing new product in company history,"" and notes that the technology is ""resonating"" with businesses.

Union workers rejected Boeing's (BA) latest labor contract proposal, prolonging the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers' (IMA) strike that began in September. The aircraft manufacturer also reported third quarter results on Wednesday, revealing a $6 billion net loss for the quarter, which includes a $2 billion loss in its aerospace and defense programs.

The 10-year Treasury yield (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) is pushing back above 4.2% as investors digest what recent Federal Reserve commentary means for interest rates. Truist Co-Chief Investment Officer & Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner explains, ""What I'm encouraged by somewhat here is that when I look beneath the surface, and I look at what's called credit spreads, so are we seeing something systemic? We're seeing credit spreads near the lows."" He continues, ""So that's telling me that the yields are moving higher because investors are feeling more comfortable with economic growth. And at the same time, that's paring back on how aggressive the Fed will be.""

9,film juror 2 warner studio eastwood release one theatrical million,"AFI Fest, the longest-running film festival in Los Angeles, will cap off its 38th edition Sunday evening with the world premiere of Clint Eastwood‘s “Juror #2” at the historic TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Stars Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette and Zoey Deutch will walk the red carpet, which marks the festival’s fourth world premiere of an Eastwood-directed feature. The courtroom drama is the filmmaker’s 40th directorial effort — and, given he’s 94 years old, it’s potentially his final one.

Four days later, Warner Bros. will give “Juror #2” a somewhat less distinguished treatment. The studio is putting out the feature in a limited release of less than 50 theaters, according to two sources with knowledge of the film’s distribution, with no current plans to expand to more locations in the following weeks.

While exact location counts are still being finalized, as it stands one week from opening day, “Juror #2” is currently listing showtimes at four locations around New York City, five in the Los Angeles area and one in Chicago. Across the country’s 25 most populous cities, the film is listing pre-sales in fewer than 25 locations. The film’s official website only promotes showtimes in 18 markets. Cineplex, Canada’s leading exhibitor chain, is opening the film in just one theater in Toronto and 160 nationwide venues. While many indies never expand beyond a handful of theaters, it’s less common for releases from major Hollywood studios like Warner Bros. As things currently stand, “Juror #2” will appear in far fewer auditoriums than other awards season releases like “Anora” and “The Brutalist,” which were made on leaner budgets, but will eventually unspool across thousands of screens.

Popular on Variety

“‘Juror #2’ is releasing in the U.S., U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Germany with the full support of Warner Bros.,” said a spokesperson for the studio. “The film will have its worldwide debut at the AFI Film Festival this weekend.”

Sources tell Variety that Warner Bros. is considering not reporting box office grosses for the film — an atypical practice for a traditional Hollywood studio, though not an unprecedented one. Earlier this year, Disney placed Daisy Ridley’s biographical sports drama “Young Woman and the Sea” in an undisclosed number of theaters and elected against releasing grosses. Two weeks later, the film debuted on Disney+. The decision seemed bizarre to the few who noticed: a half-measure roll-out for a film that was originally commissioned as an exclusive streaming release, but shifted to a theatrical run after testing highly. Some noted that the release meant that “Young Woman and the Sea” had fulfilled the Academy qualifications to be considered for Oscar nominations, but that seems incidental given the film hasn’t received the promotional push required for a serious awards contender.

Similarly, “Juror #2” was originally conceived as a streaming release, as first reported by Puck and confirmed by a source. The studio shifted to theatrical after screening the film, which was produced on a budget in the mid-$30 million range. While next week’s limited release will serve as an awards-qualifying run, sources tell Variety that the film is not being perceived as a major Oscar player internally at Warner Bros. Notably, “Juror #2” isn’t featured on the company’s FYC 2024 webpage. It’s not entirely unexpected, given Eastwood hasn’t proven to be an awards player since “American Sniper” landed six Academy Award nominations in 2015. Only two nods have followed since: sound editing for “Sully” in 2017, and Kathy Bates in supporting actress for “Richard Jewell” in 2020.

Yet the hush-hush rollout for “Juror #2” remains a peculiar approach for a filmmaker who still has commercial appeal. “American Sniper” was the highest-grossing domestic release of 2014. Two of Eastwood’s follow-ups, “Sully” and “The Mule,” both earned more than $100 million in North America. But in the contemporary theatrical landscape, badly rattled by the COVID pandemic, original adult-skewing dramas are perceived by studios to be much riskier theatrical prospects than they were even five years ago.

Warner Bros., the studio that Eastwood has partnered with for more than 50 years, seemed to be reevaluating its relationship with the filmmaker following the 2021 release of his most recent feature, “Cry Macho.” That Western drama, which saw a nonagenarian Eastwood directing himself as a former rodeo star finding redemption south of the border, was a box office flop, grossing $16.5 million globally against a production budget of $33 million. The film faced uphill challenges, launching in a theatrical landscape still in its first months of recovery from pandemic lockdowns. It also received a simultaneous streaming debut with a day-and-date launch on Max (then titled HBO Max), as with the rest of Warner Bros.’ theatrical slate that year.

The underperformance of the tepidly-reviewed “Cry Macho” allegedly emerged as a point of contention at the studio, amid shifting strategy in the wake of WarnerMedia’s merger with Discovery, Inc. In May 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that then-newly-minted CEO David Zaslav questioned why “Cry Macho” was made after film leadership conceded that they had doubts the movie could turn a profit. “It’s not show friends, it’s show business,” the exec was quoted.

Nonetheless, Eastwood was back in Warner Bros.’ good graces by April 2023, when the studio greenlit “Juror #2” under the leadership of Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, who were tapped to lead the WB film division in the summer prior. But now, the studio seems to have little confidence in the film’s commercial prospects. One source close to Warner Bros. says that the decision to put “Juror #2” in theaters at all represents a gesture of gratitude toward Eastwood, who has earned the company billions in box office grosses, as well as numerous awards, for films like “Unforgiven” and “Million Dollar Baby.” But does a limited rollout in a handful of venues truly qualify as an appropriate distribution plan for an industry icon who has remained loyal to a studio for decades?

10,brady olsen bunch revival actor like going cindy podcast cbs,"Cindy Brady actor Susan Olsen recently claimed on the “Walk Away Campaign” podcast (via Vanity Fair) that CBS killed a revival of “The Brady Bunch” due to her support of Donald Trump and her controversial stances on hot button issues like Covid vaccines and the LGBTQ+ community — but that’s not the whole story, insiders note. For one thing, the show was set up at CBS Studios and hadn’t even been pitched to networks or streamers yet. More importantly, sources note that it was scrapped due to hate speech by Olsen, including homophobic slurs that had previously gotten her fired from a radio gig.

The updated Brady project was considered two years ago, but it’s unclear whether even a script had been written. The project never got past those early stages when Olsen’s behavior stopped it from moving forward. The series would have picked up with the Brady Bunch children as adults. Olsen’s Cindy, the youngest Brady sibling, was going to be a libertarian podcaster, the actor revealed.

Popular on Variety

“I did have a phone call with my [TV] siblings and my agent,” Olsen said on the podcast. “Everybody was saying, ‘We’re sorry, but they just won’t budge. They just will not have you in this.’ I was like, ‘Wow, I’ve been canceled.’ A role that I’ve played for over 50 years, I can’t play it now because I’m too dangerous. I was like ‘Well, okay guys, good luck, I hope you can sell it.’”

CBS Studios declined comment. According to Olsen, she was in talks for a “Brady Bunch” revival for about a year. She was allegedly questioned during the show’s early development about her politics by the revival’s showrunner and the son of Sherwood Schwartz, who created the original “Brady Bunch.” The actor was previously fired from the “Two Chicks Talkin’ Politics” radio show in 2016 after she shared anti-LGBTQ views on social media; she reportedly later responded to a guest (who had criticized her on social media) by sending him a text message filled with slurs and hate speech.

Olsen starred as Cindy Brady for the entire run of “The Brady Bunch,” which aired from 1969 to 1974. She also appeared in the animated spinoff “The Brady Kids,” as well as 1976’s “The Brady Bunch Variety Hour,” the 1981 TV movie “The Brady Girls Get Married” and 1990’s “The Bradys.”

Per Vanity Fair’s recap of Olsen’s interview: “According to Olsen, the revival was going to thrust the Brady Bunch family into the modern era. One of Jan’s children was going to be trans, and one of the Bradys was going to have a Black spouse. This, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not sit right with Olsen. ‘To that I was like, come on, let’s not be so obvious. Let’s make this Black spouse somebody who has a really close relationship with another Brady, and that’s how this Brady met them. Give them a foundation so this isn’t a token position.'”

Olsen went on to say the “Brady Bunch” revival series is “dead in the water” now.

11,theatrical movies predator streaming movie one next idea alien great,"This was the summer that theatrical audiences really refamiliarized themselves with the famous 20th Century logo, arcing searchlights and all. The Disney-owned division was everywhere, thanks to hits Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Alien: Romulus, not to mention The First Omen. Even Deadpool & Wolverine, which grossed $1.3 billion, featured the logo before and in the movie, which was in part a love letter to the Fox era Marvel movies.

Guiding 20th is the steady hand of Steve Asbell, the longtime Fox exec who became president of the division in 2020, just when the pandemic hit. He navigated the transitional movies and then the pandemic movies, and then the switch to streaming and back to theatrical again.

But as much as the summer’s movies were about franchises long ago, the studio has one eye very much on the future. It is working with up-and-coming filmmakers on streaming features that it could pivot to theatrical if an opportunity opens up. And it’s stepping on the gas on some original theatrical movies.

“All of this success gives us equity and momentum to sort of take these shots,” says Asbell noting the division goes into production on a Bruce Springsteen feature starring Jeremy Allen White later this month and is due to shoot Send Help with Sam Raimi in January. Next year it will release a comedy from James L. Brookes and Rami Malek spy thriller The Amateur. More projects will get underway in the summer.

Even the offices are lively these days, with a life-size Planet Apes simian, adorned with cool shades, greeting visitors and a handsome wood-and-glass case being built to house the division’s many historical Oscars.

With Alien wrapping up its theatrical run in October and Springsteen close to starting production, Asbell, who oversees nine production executives along with their support teams, is catching his breath, if only for a moment. But he sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss balancing streaming and theatrical, originals and established IP, and spilled more than he should about two, yes we said two, Predator movies coming next year.

This was in many ways the summer that 20th Century Studios came into its own within the Disney empire. So what does it mean being 20th Century Studios in 2024?

I’ve been here five years now almost, and it’s been an amazing journey with Disney in fact, because there is no sort of us and them, it’s just us. I mean, Alan [Bergman, Disney co-chair] has been a champion of ours since the beginning. He’s been supportive of our slate from the very beginning, all through marketing, distribution, publicity. We’re all very close now and we’re all friends. It feels very integrated and it feels like this summer, in particular, we were able to contribute to the larger Disney model. And now we have David Greenbaum, who’s, happily for me, a very old friend of mine. He’s an executive of impeccable taste and he’s brought a real energy, frankly, to both divisions. And so what it means is I think filmmakers, great franchises, and original films for both theatrical and streaming.

Where is the balance between originals and franchise plays?

Right now it’s looking like next year, half the slate. Job one was figuring out these franchise movies first and coming up with the right cadence of Avatar, Apes, Alien and Predator specifically. Getting those right was the first part, which we’ve done now. And so that idea is to be able to say, “Okay, we know when the Avatar movies are coming. We know now about Predator. There’ll be another Apes in ‘27, let’s just say.”So knowing where we can plan those franchises, it helps us look to see and ask what kinds of original movies in terms of genre do we want to test the marketplace with?

How do you decide which ones go streaming and which ones don’t?

The landscape has changed so that theatrical is back. There’s a lot more opportunity in theatrical films, but since the consolidation of Disney+ and Hulu, there’s a tremendous audience for those [streaming] films. There’s still that thing with the streaming movies where we can really take chances with it and they can sort of be what they need to be. They don’t necessarily have to hit that theatrical threshold of, “how much is it? How many screens?”

Alien: Romulus was supposed to go straight to streaming, but that changed right before filming. So what prompted that change?

It was started as a streaming movie because we started development when we were in COVID and it wasn’t clear what our strategy was going to be theatrical or streaming. At the time we had different sorts of budget categories for streaming, which we were always circumspect about not wanting to spend too much money on streaming movies. We didn’t know quite yet how they would perform based on the metrics. And the truth is we started it hoping that theatrical would return to some measure of normal. But we made that film and, frankly, every other film we’ve made for streaming, with the same care and curation as we do our theatrical movies.

What’s the next step for Alien?

We’re working on a sequel idea now. We haven’t quite closed our deal with Fede [Alvarez], but we are going to, and he has an idea that we’re working on. The two survivors, Rain and Andy, played by Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, were real highlights of the film. And so I always think of it like, “Wow, where do people want to see them go next?” We know there’s going to be aliens. We know there’s going to be great horror set pieces. But I fell in love with both of them and I want to see what their story is.

Jon Landau, who was producing the Avatar movies, sadly passed away this summer. Has the day-to-day on Avatar 3 changed at all?

It’s just hard personally, because Jon’s somebody I talked to every day and he was a mentor to me and a good friend and had unbelievable impact on everybody. I mean, it’s a huge loss. He was a great, great friend and a great sort of half mind to Jim [Cameron], however he describes it. We just miss him every day. But it hasn’t changed. It hasn’t affected the release date or Jim’s timeline or anything of that. We were already on a track that has its own milestones and guideposts.

Lightning round on 20th Century titles! Free Guy 2?

Not yet. [Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds] have to come up with an idea. And they’re just busy.

Kingsman sequels or prequels.

There’s no plans on doing them anytime soon.

More Agatha Christie mystery movies.

More, yes. We have, And Then There Were None. We have Witness for the Prosecution. We’re doing Miss Marple. There’s a bunch of other titles that we’re working on. We have very close relationship with the estate.

A Master and Commander prequel?

I’m trying so hard. It’s the first movie I worked on at Fox twenty years ago. We have a great script. It just needs the right director.

Any Die Hard plans?

No, not yet.

Here’s a big one. Will the next Predator movie get a theatrical release? [Editors note: this conversation took place before Disney dated Predator: Badlands for a 2025 release in theaters.]

Yes. And no.

You’re killing me here.

Yes, a Predator movie will have a theatrical. I’ll tell you very simply. After Prey became a success, Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do Prey 2. And we’re like, “What do you want to do?” And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool. We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action Predator film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year.

You’re blowing my mind. Let’s tackle this one at time. One Predator movie is coming out theatrically?

It’s titled Badlands and it is an absolutely bonkers idea. It is a sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is. And I mean, it’s awesome. It is so nuts. But in Dan, we trust.

Now you said there’s a second Predator movie.

There’s a second Predator movie that we have different plans for. Dan has actually directed both.

So there’s a secret Predator movie—

There’s a secret Predator movie that will come out before the theatrical one that I can’t say anything about yet.

Fine. Will we eventually see another Alien vs. Predator?

Probably.

Not sure how I feel about that.

It wouldn’t be in the way you think. That’s the thing. Not in the way that it will just be called Alien vs. Predator or anything like the original movies. If we do this, they’ll be organically created out of these two franchises that we’ve continued with characters that we fall in love with and those characters will combine…perhaps. But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.

At a 30th anniversary screening of Speed a few weeks ago, Sandra Bullock said Hollywood may not be brave enough for a Speed 3. Response?

Hollywood is brave enough. We are brave enough. We are sitting by the phone. (Laughs)

It is one of those last movies that we haven’t remade. And to really be a reason to come back, it’s got to be a great idea and an idea that excites (Bullock and Keanu Reeves). Because that’d be the reason to see it. It’s obviously a really important title for us, but it’s not something we would handle lightly or just try to press them into service. They’d have to be a part of the development of that idea.

12,new musical broadway production theatre show also tony design back,"Back to the Future: the Musical is leaving New York at 88 miles per hour. The Broadway production, which opened at the Winter Garden Theatre August 3, 2023, will play its final performance January 5, 2025, after playing more than 500 performances.

The closing makes the show the second musical to announce a closing date on ""Black Sunday,"" the first Sunday after New Year's that tends to kick off steep drop in tourism throughout New York City. Suffs will also close January 5.



Based on the 1985 Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment film about teenager Marty McFly—who is accidentally transported back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by Dr. Emmett Brown—the musical has a book by Bob Gale, and new music and lyrics by Alan Silvestri and Glen Ballard, with additional songs from the film, including “The Power of Love” and “Johnny B. Goode.”

As previously announced, a German staging of the musical will open in the 2025–2026 season, with details to be announced. The show is also headed to Royal Caribbean's new cruise ship Star of the Seas in a 100-minute condensed iteration. That staging will debut along with the ship when it disembarks from Port Canaveral in Orlando, Florida, in August 2025.

Said producer Colin Ingram, “With nearly 40 percent of our audience never having seen a production on Broadway before, I’m proud that at a time when theatre is viewed by so many as being inaccessible that this show was able to bring in a new audience, and it is my hope that this legacy endures and these people return to see another Broadway show in the future. We are having the same success across the North American tour where the show has already been seen by half a million people—many also new to the theatre. We look forward to welcoming fans to the theatre with four new productions opening next year including Japan and Germany as they join our two existing productions in London’s West End (now in its 4th year) and the North American tour.”



The Broadway cast currently features Tony winner and 2024 Tony nominee Roger Bart as Doc Brown, Casey Likes as Marty McFly, Liana Hunt as Lorraine Baines, Jelani Remy as Goldie Wilson/Marvin Berry, Evan Alexander Smith as George McFly, David Josefsberg as Strickland, and Nathaniel Hackmann as Biff Tannen.

Tony winner John Rando directs. The production also features set and costume design by Tim Hatley, lighting design by Tim Lutkin and Hugh Vanstone, sound design by Gareth Owen, video design by Finn Ross, choreography by Chris Bailey, musical supervision and arrangements by Nick Finlow, illusions by Chris Fisher, orchestrations by Ethan Popp and Bryan Crook, dance arrangements by David Chase, and casting by Tara Rubin. Bespoke Theatricals serves as general manager.



Back to the Future: The Musical made its world premiere at the Manchester Opera House in March 2020. The West End production opened in London September 13, 2021, at the Adelphi Theatre (where it continues) and subsequently won the Best New Musical Olivier Award. The Broadway production was nominated for two Tony awards, taking home none.

“John Wick” fans might want to start thanking Eva Longoria.

The “Desperate Housewives” star quietly invested millions of dollars in the action franchise’s first movie, saving “John Wick” from potential oblivion, director Chad Stahelski said in a Business Insider interview published Monday.

“We were less than a week out and we lost almost $6 million on a gap financing,” Stahelski recalled amid the 10th anniversary of the film’s release. “We were financing independently to get the bond, but one of the investors couldn’t raise the money in time.”

He added, “[Longoria] came to the rescue and she provided the gap financing” less than 24 hours before a crucial deadline — though producer Basil Iwanyk hadn’t told him how this windfall arrived.

So Stahelski was blown away when he “found out by the end of the movie” that Longoria, known for her suburban escapades on ABC’s “Desperate Housewives,” was the one who’d stepped in to help.

“Basil took us out to dinner, and we were laughing about all the bullshit that happened, and he said: ‘By the way, funny story, you know who gap financed you? Eva Longoria,’” Stahelski told Business Insider, remembering his shock at the news.

Centered on a retired assassin seeking vengeance on gangsters who killed his dog, the first “John Wick” film took in over $86 million worldwide against a $20 million budget, spawning a billion-dollar franchise known for its stunt work and choreographed fights while further establishing actor Keanu Reeves as an action hero.

But the movie marked just one of many Hollywood investments for Longoria, who founded the production company Unbelievable Entertainment in 2005 and has helped produce TV series like Lifetime’s “Devious Maids,” NBC’s “Telenovela” and ABC’s “Grand Hotel.”

Following the success of “John Wick,” Stahelski said, “We took her out to lunch at [Los Angeles hot spot] Chateau Marmont and she was laughing going, ‘I didn’t think it was going to work.’” But fortunately for Longoria, it did.

14,lopez combs noa jennifer sean 2000 diddy parties ojani relationship,"Sean 'Puffy' Combs with Jennifer Lopez in the audience at the 1st Annual Latin Grammy Awards broadcast on Wednesday, September 13, 2000 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA.

Jennifer Lopez has been accused of attending and participating in Sean “Diddy” Combs’ now-infamous “freak-off” parties during their time as a couple.

Ojani Noa, J.Lo’s first husband, took to social media to distance himself from any connection to Combs’ “freak-off” parties, but gladly claimed that the singer and actress was one of multiple celebrities present at those affairs.

In a post on Instagram, Noa shared a list of stars who’ve allegedly attended Diddy’s parties, one being Lopez, whom Combs dated during the late ’90s and early ’00s.

Jennifer Lopez and Sean “Puffy” Combs arrive for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards September 7, 2000 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

“I’M NOT ON THE LIST,” Noa captioned the post. “To those people and media outlets asking if I ever went or participated in that Piece of Sh*t (DIDDY’S) Freak-Off Parties. No and No. Never. But my Ex-Wife (Jennifer Lopez) a.k.a (JLO) Did.. Ask Her.”

Lopez’s disgruntled former lover continued, urging the public to question her regarding the alleged explicit recordings and other questionable items federal agents claim to have found during their investigation into Combs.

“Oh and ask her about the SEX TAPES,” he added. “The 734 Dildos And The BABY OIL.”

Noa has expressed his seeming disdain for both Lopez and Combs in recent weeks amid the latter’s federal indictment and arrest on racketeering and sex trafficking charges in September.

Ojani, who married Lopez in February 1997 before the couple divorced less than a year later, blames their split on Combs’ working relationship with Lopez.

That relationship, which was forged during the making of Lopez’s debut album, On the 6, later became romantic, with Diddy and Lopez dating between 1999 and 2001 before calling it quits.

“She went from Jen to being J Lo, this big business bringing in millions,” Noa once told Daily Mail of the shift in their relationship. “She had all these new people around her, all wanting to make money off her. I would call and an assistant would say, ‘Sorry, she’s not available.’”

15,combs new 11 court celebrity victim diddy party claims seen,"New photo evidence submitted in court illustrates Sean “Diddy” Combs’ behavior at his booze-fueled parties where he allegedly assaulted men, women and minors.

New images show the embattled rapper dancing at a party at his suite at the Planet Hollywood Hotel while surrounded by young women and bottles of vodka, according to an action filed by Texas-based lawyer Tony Buzbee on Sunday and obtained by Page Six.

An alleged victim has also supplied images of plastic vials allegedly used by Combs or his staffers to slip GHB — a date-rape drug — into drinks, the lawsuit claims.

The attorney’s latest filing alleges that the music mogul sexually assaulted at least seven victims, one of whom was just 13 at the time.

The now-37-year-old woman claims that Combs, 54, and two other celebrities raped her at a 2000 MTV Video Music Awards afterparty.

“Combs aggressively approached Plaintiff with a crazed look in his eyes, grabbed her and said, ‘You are ready to party!’” the 19-page action filed in New York federal court Sunday stated.

The anonymous victim was held down by a male celebrity who “vaginally raped her” while Combs and a female celebrity “watched,” the lawsuit claims.

“After the male celebrity finished, Combs then vaginally raped Plaintiff while the Celebrity A and Celebrity B watched,” the documents state.

Another client of Buzbee, an unnamed luxury car businessman, claims that Combs attempted to assault him at a Ciroc party around 2022 but was stopped by a professional athlete.

Buzbee, who announced he was representing 120 individuals in civil lawsuits accusing Combs of egregious sex crimes, filed at least five new civil lawsuits in the Southern District of New York this week. In the new motion, one of the men and all three women accused the Bad Boy Records founder of drugging them.

Combs’ legal team has denied the accusations, telling Page Six in a statement, “Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts, their legal defenses, and the integrity of the judicial process. In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone — adult or minor, man or woman.”

The “I’ll Be Missing You” artist has maintained his innocence after being hit with a wave of accusations this year.

Combs first denied any wrongdoing in November 2023 when his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed a lawsuit accusing him of raping, sex-trafficking and physically abusing her throughout their decade-long relationship.

Combs settled the case less than 24 hours later but was forced to issue a public apology when a video of him violently assaulting the “Me & U” singer at a hotel in 2016 surfaced online.

Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges and is being held behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY, after being denied bail.

16,miley cyrus parton billy ray father dolly dad relationship family,"Miley Cyrus Reportedly Wants Godmother Dolly Parton 'To Stop The Forgiveness Campaign' For Estranged Dad

Miley Cyrus is drawing a hard line regarding her godmother, Dolly Parton, reportedly asking her to stop trying to mend fences with her estranged father, Billy Ray Cyrus.

The close bond between the women seems to be tested as Miley draws a firm boundary around her father's involvement. This comes after the pop star publicly discussed her strained relationship with Billy Ray.

As tensions rise, Miley Cyrus is making it clear she wants Dolly Parton to focus on their relationship, not her father's.

Miley Cyrus Reportedly Wants Dolly Parton To Cut Ties With Estranged Dad

Instagram | Dolly Parton

Sources close to Miley claim she has asked her godmother to stop trying to play peacemaker between her and her dad.

The family drama has been simmering for years, ever since the 31-year-old opposed Billy Ray's relationship with Firerose, his now ex, who is nearly three decades younger.

A source revealed that the tension has reportedly taken a toll on Parton, who is heartbroken over the rift within the Cyrus family. Still, Dolly has reportedly kept trying to repair the relationship between the father and daughter duo, but it seems her efforts have been in vain.

According to insiders, Miley is not interested in reconciliation. ""For Miley, that ship has sailed. She wants nothing to do with her dad and wants Parton to stop the forgiveness campaign,"" the insider shared with In Touch.

In fact, Miley has gone a step further, suggesting Parton cut ties with Billy Ray altogether, viewing it as a matter of loyalty. Despite Miley's demands, it is doubtful that her iconic godmother will be easily swayed. As one source put it:

""It's highly unlikely Dolly will be bossed around by Miley though, she's a woman who knows her own mind!""

Inside Billy Ray Cyrus' Leaked Audio Of Tirade Against Ex-Wife

Billy Ray Cyrus

With the 63-year-old's leaked tantrum, it is not making things easier for Parton, who has been trying to heal the rift between him and his daughter.

The country singer was caught in a leaked audio recording berating his ex-fiancée, Firerose, with a string of expletives, calling her a ""selfish f–king b-tch"" for making him late to a last-minute gig.

But what might be worse is Miley not just hearing her father's harsh words toward Firerose—it would be hearing him trash her mother, Tish Cyrus, in the same rant.

Billy Ray and Tish, who share five adult children, including Miley, have divorced for over a year, but the wounds have not healed. According to an insider, the audio also left a lasting impression on Parton.

""Dolly is not impressed by the way Billy Ray has treated anyone. Lately, she was appalled by what came out during his divorce from Firerose, and of course, she would never support him hurting Miley,"" the source revealed.

Miley has not shied away from addressing the rocky relationship she has with Billy Ray, especially after his third divorce. While the family drama might have intensified the tension, Miley's reflections on their past shed light on the complicated bond they share.

In a candid June interview with David Letterman on his Netflix show ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,"" the actress opened up about her father's influence.

The Blast reported that Miley shared how Billy Ray's connection to the real world, even during his height of fame, left a lasting impression on her.

While Miley acknowledged the valuable lessons she has learned from her dad, she also got brutally honest about the more challenging aspects of their relationship.

""I also inherited the narcissism from my father,"" she admitted, giving a glimpse into their dynamic pairing.

The Disney Channel Alum also set the record straight on rumors surrounding her family's alleged feud during her interview with Letterman. When the topic of her supposed estrangement from her parents came up, Miley decided to address the situation directly.

Agreeing with the host's observation that ""there's no estrangement,"" the songwriter explained that the changes in her family were simply a natural part of life.

""It's just the way things played out,"" she shared, downplaying the idea of any major fallout. Miley went on to express her deep appreciation for the sacrifices her parents made to support their children's dreams.

While her relationship with her father has been strained in recent years, Miley still credits him with being a huge influence on her creative mind.Reflecting on the impact her father had on her, the pop star explained that his artistic nature shaped the way she views the world.

""Without my dad, I know — I mean, not just literally I wouldn't be sitting in this chair, I wouldn't exist — but I would not, who I am as a person, it wouldn't exist,"" she shared, and then added:

""Because my dad, as a creative and as an artist in the way that his brain works, has always made me feel safer in my own mind because we're very similar in our ideas.""

After acknowledging the deep influence her dad has had on her, she also highlighted the essential role her mother played in her upbringing. ""Really, my mom raised me,"" she explained. But for Miley, the admiration for her mom goes far beyond the day-to-day, noting, ""Honestly, my mom is my hero.""

With both Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus seemingly on opposite sides of an ever-growing divide, it is uncertain whether even Dolly Parton's nurturing influence can bring the family back together.",985,"parton, miley, stop, ray, wants, cyrus, billy, relationship, godmother, family, dolly, forgiveness, reportedly, estranged, dad"
17,movies said content teens like shows screen entertainment respondents adolescents,"Teens want movies and shows to stay in the friend zone.

At a time when films like “Babygirl,” “Poor Things” and “Fair Play” and series such as “Disclaimer” and “Tell Me Lies” are more explicitly sexual, younger audiences are hoping that more Hollywood stars stay clothed on screen and that the entertainment industry focuses on characters who are in platonic relationships. That’s one key finding from a new study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles’ Center for Scholars & Storytellers. Entitled “Teens & Screens,” the report surveyed roughly 1,500 respondents, aged 10 to 24.

Researchers found that 63.5% of adolescents said they preferred that big and small screen stories focus on friendships, while 62.4% said sexual content isn’t needed as a plot device. Those are big jumps from the previous year when 51.5% of those surveyed said they wanted more content about people in platonic relationships, and 47.5% said that they didn’t seek out shows or movies where sex was a major plot point. The survey did not poll respondents between the ages of 10 to 13 about their attitudes on sexually explicit content.

Popular on Variety

“Our findings really seemed to solidify a trend we found emerging in our data last year: that young people are tired of seeing the same dated and unrelatable romantic tropes on screen,” said Alisha J. Hines, director of research at the center. “Teens and young adults want to see stories that more authentically reflect a full spectrum of nuanced relationships.”

Instead, 36.2% of adolescents said enjoyed content that took place in fantasy worlds over stories about the rich and famous (7.2%), real-life issues (13.9%), personal issues (24.2%) or other genres (3.3%). And when it came to their favorite types of entertainment, 39.2% of teens opted for playing video games, compared to 33.3% who chose watching TV or movies and 27.5% who picked scrolling on social media platforms.

When it came to digital forms of entertainment, 38.8% of adolescents said that YouTube was the “most authentic” social media platform, followed by TikTok (36.3%) and Instagram (28.3%) — X, formerly known as Twitter, was the least authentic with 18.1% of respondents favoring it.

Erotic movies were once a popular genre, with movies like “Indecent Proposal” and “Basic Instinct” topping box office charts. But after those movies declined and television programs like “Game of Thrones” and “The Affair” became more permissive, Hollywood invested less money in explicit content. That seems to be shifting in recent months, with an onslaught of more sexually provocative content hitting screens. But it looks like those movies and shows will need to attract older audiences, at least if the study’s findings are to be believed.",446,"surveyed, study, screen, entertainment, movies, adolescents, young, finds, tv, teens, content, shows, sex, respondents"
18,said harris town hall president voters vote still right thistle,"Vice President Kamala Harris speaks with Pam Thistle after a CNN Presidential Town Hall in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, October 23. Rebecca Wright/CNN

Some voters who stayed to talk with CNN after the town hall with Kamala Harris on Wednesday in Pennsylvania said they have made up their mind. Two of five of the voters who spoke with CNN’s John King are leaving the town hall planning to vote for Harris — but others said they still have major policy concerns.

One of the voters, Joe Donahue, did not raise his hand when asked if he was going to vote for Harris and said there are still some “personal policy difference,” specifically on abortion.

“The right to life is so fundamental in this country that it becomes — without that right being respected, it’s incredibly difficult to talk about anything else,” Donahue said.

Still, Donahue said he is still “not sold” on former President Donald Trump either because “his personality” and his actions on January 6, 2021. Harris spoke with him after the town hall, which he said meant “quite a bit” to him and appreciated given the fact that they have opposing ideas.

Pam Thistle said she left the town hall with a “a feeling of adoration” for Harris personally, but as a widow raising children, the economy and paying her bills is her top concern: “I really do have to vote for my family.”

“And another thing that is very much a turn off, and this is with both candidates — stop trashing each other. We don’t care. Stop trashing Trump. Trump, stop trashing the vice president. We don’t care,” Thistle said, adding that’s not what voters care about.

Taneisha Spall echoed that sentiment, saying she would respect Harris more if she stayed out of the “schoolyard bulling” and ran on her policy positions. She said she doesn’t feel like Harris needs to lodge attacks and that she thinks “it’s beneath her.”

Erik Svendsen said he has decided to vote for Harris. He said hearing Harris admit that she doesn’t know the answer to everything and she has people around her that she can trust resonated with him.

“I don’t need a president that knows everything or thinks they know everything, because that’s not what America needs,” Svendsen said. “They need to put the right people in the right place to lead the country efficiently.

19,health h5n1 missouri person contact bird flu among dairy case,"As H5N1 bird flu continues to spread wildly among California dairy herds and farmworkers, federal health officials on Thursday offered some relatively good news about Missouri: The wily avian influenza virus does not appear to have spread from the state's sole human case, which otherwise remains a mystery.

On September 6, the Missouri Health department announced that a person with underlying health conditions tested positive for bird flu, and later testing indicated that it was an H5N1 strain related to the one currently circulating among US dairy cows. But, state and federal health officials were—and still are—stumped as to how that person became infected. The person had no known contact with infected animals and no contact with any obviously suspect animal products. No dairy herds in Missouri have tested positive, and no poultry farms had reported recent outbreaks, either. To date, all other human cases of H5N1 have been among farmworkers who had contact with H5N1-infected animals.

But aside from the puzzle, attention turned to the possibility that the unexplained Missouri case had passed on the infection to those around them. A household contact had symptoms at the same time as the person—aka the index case—and at least six health care workers developed illnesses after interacting with the person. One of the six had tested negative for bird flu around the time of their illness, but questions remained about the other five.

Defining a case

In a press briefing Thursday, Demetre Daskalakis, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced that blood testing definitively indicated that all five of those health workers were not infected with H5N1. The blood testing involved three types of tests looking for neutralizing antibodies and other evidence of immune system responses that the body would have produced to fight an infection. All five health care workers were negative for all three types of tests.",310,"end, contact, rampant, tested, dead, running, bird, health, person, workers, california, testing, infected, h5n1, missouri, flu, hit"
20,animal chick chicks welfare could emotional study states animals vocalisations,"Summary: Researchers have developed a way to measure stress in baby chicks using vocalizations, offering new insights into animal emotions. The study found that chicks alone produced higher-pitched, louder calls, indicating anxiety-like states, while calmer chicks showed more relaxed vocal patterns.

These findings could lead to more humane practices in the poultry industry and enhance testing of anxiety medications for humans. The study highlights the importance of considering animal emotions for improving welfare standards across livestock industries.

Key Facts:

Chick vocalizations reveal anxiety-like states, helping monitor animal welfare.

Vocal stress detection could replace invasive methods like hormone blood tests.

Insights may improve both poultry industry practices and human anxiety research.

Understanding animal emotions has been a long-running question at the forefront of welfare studies, but a University of Mississippi professor’s work may hold the key to decoding the chatter.

The answer involves two baby chickens and a mirror.

Kenneth Sufka, professor of psychology and pharmacology, partnered with a team of animal welfare researchers in the United Kingdom to study avian emotions through the common domestic chick’s peeps and whistles.

Their research was recently published in Applied Behaviour Science.

Their findings could improve animal welfare across the poultry production industry. It could also improve testing for medications to treat depression and anxiety in people.

“Is there a noninvasive way that can capture in freely moving animals a measure of stress states?” he said. “That was the question we wanted to address in this chick study, looking at the calling or the vocalizations that are emitted, but in a way more sophisticated way than I have ever done.”

To conduct the study, the UK researchers expanded on previous results from Dr. Sufka’s lab. The experimental set up involved complex acoustic equipment in a secluded room. In one box, they placed a chick, and in another, they placed a chick with a mirror.

The chicken that can see its reflection believes it is not alone, and its calls represent a relatively calm chick, that isn’t too stressed. The chick that is alone, however, begins to voice loud, higher pitched sounds that the researchers believe could indicate an anxiety-like state. The acoustic data the researchers gathered measured how the quality of the chick’s vocalizations changed, and what that meant for their stress level.

Being able to detect stress could open the doorway to more humane, responsive practices in the meat and egg industry.

“In production facilities, in commercial growing facilities across the board – be it cattle, swine or avian models like chickens – there’s a real concern about welfare,” he said. “Is this a worthwhile thing, to be thinking about using acoustics to monitor animal welfare in these production facilities? I think so.”

While researchers – and farmers – have long known that a loud chick is a distressed chick, the knowledge never went much deeper than that, said Sarah Collins, coauthor and associate professor of animal behavior at the University of Plymouth.

“This is more evidence of animal sentience – the ability to experience feelings,” she said. “We have known for a while that chick distress calls mean they are stressed, but knowing we can tell how stressed means we can assess welfare more precisely.”

The study also presents a noninvasive, comparatively inexpensive way to study anxiety-like states in animals. In previous models, the way to measure an animal’s stress levels included capturing it, withdrawing blood and measuring levels of corticosterone, a stress hormone.

“That itself is stressful – to capture, restrain, collect, release,” Sufka said. “This, we think, is a better way.”

Medications intended for humans often must go through chick, rat and primate studies before any testing on human subjects. But since chicks are often used as an early precursor to human studies, understanding their emotions could improve studies on anxiety and depression medication.

Like many humans, chicks are often resistant to many common depression medications, making them a prime subject for alternative treatments. But if researchers cannot prove that the chick first has anxiety-like symptoms, they cannot show that a medication improves that state.

“To claim that an anti-anxiety drug is alleviating an anxiety-like state, this chick or mouse or rat has to have an anxiety state similar to yours,” Sufka said. “The behavior (of an animal in an anxiety-like state) is totally different, but it’s behavior in the context of what that animal does.

“If I make an argument that I’ve got a drug that reduces that state, that would necessitate in a validation argument that animals have to have emotional states.”

But the research also points toward an answer to an older, more complex question: What rights do animals have? The long-held answer is that animals do not have the same emotional capabilities as humans, and therefore have fewer needs and wants.

“My argument is that all of the work that we have done to-date shows the similarities between this avian model and human anxiety and depressive states makes a very strong argument that these animals do have negative emotional states,” Sufka said.

“And if that’s true, then ethically it follows that we are absolutely obligated to be worried about animal welfare and provide for the best living conditions possible.”

“Do I sound anxious? Emotional arousal is linked to changes in vocalisations in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus dom.)” by Kenneth Sufka et al. Applied Animal Behavior Science

Abstract

Do I sound anxious? Emotional arousal is linked to changes in vocalisations in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus dom.)

A major goal in animal welfare science is the development of methods that quantify or ‘read-out’ current affective states in freely behaving animals.

In mammalian models, changes in acoustic parameters within vocalisations have been linked to differences in emotional arousal, although there are very few studies showing changes in vocalisations that act as indicators of valence (positive or negative affect).

Currently, there are very few studies on vocal indicators of emotion in birds.

To determine the link between acoustic parameters within vocalisations and emotion in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus dom.), we used a well-validated paradigm that purports to elicit two distinct, negative emotional states: anxiety and depression.

In this paradigm, chicks in social isolation initially show high rates of distress calls (anxiety-like phase: high arousal/negative affect) that decrease over the next 20–30 minutes to a depression-like phase (low arousal/negative affect).

We analysed acoustic parameters of distress vocalisations from Legbar chicks (4–7 days old) that were placed in social isolation for 30 minutes, either with or without a mirror (Isolated: n=18; Mirror: n=16), (a mirror is known to reduce the negative behavioural and physiological indicators of isolation).

Chicks in the Isolated condition produced louder calls, of a higher frequency, and calls were individually longer, and more ‘degraded’ (higher entropy and lower harmonics-to-noise ratio) compared to the Mirror condition.

However, the call rate did not drop below 50 % of the initial rate in either condition, indicating the chicks in this study did not reach the criteria for the depression-like phase of the paradigm.

To investigate further we analysed vocalisations at times during a trial when calls were at a high rate per minute (indicating a higher level of emotional arousal at that point in time) and we found those vocalisations were louder, more ‘degraded’, longer and higher in frequency across both conditions.

These results are consistent with findings across several species of mammal, indicating that changes in emotional arousal in negatively valanced situations give rise to consistent changes in vocal parameters across a wide range of species.

Indeed, further work could look to see if the same links are found in groups such as chelonians, crocodilians and geckos, as their vocal production mechanisms share some similarities.

There could also be scope to use these changes to automatically detect shifts in emotion in captive animals.",1346,"states, welfare, vocalisations, study, animals, chick, animal, chicks, calls, emotional, reveal, anxietylike"
21,rizzo foods sugar fruit juices vegan 5 pastries packaged disease,"She’s over the moon pie.

Jenna Rizzo, a weight loss coach from Georgia, is sharing the three types of groceries banned from her home — individually wrapped pastries, sodas and fruit juices and packaged vegan food.

“If you love these foods, go right ahead and eat them,” Rizzo advised her 83,000 TikTok followers in a video this month. “It’s just in my personal experience that these foods are just not generally conducive to overall health and weight loss goals, but it’s your life.”

Individual pastries

5 Packaged pastries are ultra-processed foods, notorious for having lots of calories, sugar, fat and salt and little to no vitamins or fiber.

Rizzo placed Little Debbie Snacks, HoneyBuns and Pop-Tarts on her naughty list.

“These foods are on the banned list because we know they really don’t provide a lot of nutritional value for us — very high in saturated fat, very high in processed sugar,” Rizzo explained.

Packaged pastries are ultra-processed foods, notorious for having lots of calories, sugar, fat and salt and little to no vitamins or fiber.

Yet these disgraced foodstuffs are responsible for an astounding 60% of Americans’ daily caloric intake.

UPFs have been tied to 32 poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and even premature death.

But that doesn’t mean Rizzo completely eschews sweets.

“I love sweets so much,” she shared. “If I want a pastry, I’m gonna go to my local bakery and get something that was made fresh and with love, not something that’s meant to be shelf-stable for 13 months.”

Sodas and fruit juices

Sodas have long held a poor reputation for containing plenty of sugar and calories but no vitamins, minerals or fiber. Fruit juices, however, have earned a mixed reputation.

“I think we can all agree that we know soda is not the healthiest thing, but fruit juices typically surprise a lot of people,” Rizzo reasoned. “That’s because they’re thinking they’re drinking this good, healthy thing. In reality, most juices are just like a bunch of processed sugar made to taste like grapes or apples.”

Sugar-sweetened beverages — which include soft drinks, fruit drinks, sports drinks, energy drinks and sweetened water, coffee and tea refreshments — provide the most added sugar in the American adult diet, according to a 2023 study in the journal Nutrients.

Nearly seven in 10 adults have made SSBs part of their weekly diet, with 38% admitting they drink at least one or more a day.

SSB consumers run the risk of gaining weight, developing Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, experiencing tooth decay and impairing brain function.

Rizzo prefers making fruit juice at home so she can control the ingredients.

Rizzo’s beef is specifically with vegan UPFs — not all vegan foods.

“People see that label that it’s vegan and automatically think it’s going to be the healthier option,” Rizzo said. “Eating these fake meats and butters and cheeses that literally have an ingredient list longer than a CVS receipt did nothing more for my health.”

22,cdc virus get vaccines dose updated americans covid immunocompromised second,"Less than half of Americans plan to get COVID or flu vaccines this year, survey finds

Immunocompromised people and those who are age 65 or older should get a second dose of the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine, according to the latest recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a statement released Wednesday, the CDC said the second dose should be received six months after the first dose.

The CDC also said its recommendations allow for flexibility for those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised to consider additional doses (three or more). in consultation with their health care provider.

In August, the Food and Drug Administration greenlit updated COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna for the 2024 fall season. The updated shots were revised to target the KP.2 variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and medical experts say it will also provide protection against other recent strains.

This was part of a now-annual process undertaken by the FDA and health authorities around the world to update the vaccines to protect against newer strains of the virus.

Similar to previous seasons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all Americans ages 6 months and older get a shot of the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine to protect against another expected surge of the virus this fall and winter.

Still, as another fall virus season approaches, not everyone is following the CDC's advice. According to a survey from Ohio State Wexner Medical Center last month, less than half of Americans were planning to get their COVID or flu shots this season.

""Data continues to confirm the importance of vaccination to protect those most at risk for severe outcomes of COVID-19,"" the CDC noted in the latest release. ""Receiving recommended 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines can restore and enhance protection against the virus variants currently responsible for most infections and hospitalizations in the United States.""

The CDC also reminded the public that the COVID-19 vaccine can help reduce the chances of suffering the effects of long COVID.

Editor's note: This story has been updated to clarify that the second dose is recommended for everyone age 65 or over, as well as people who are immunocompromised.

A groundbreaking study by researchers at Florida State University’s Gut Biome Lab has revealed a potential link between an infection caused by gut bacteria and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

The research found that the bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae — a common bacteria notorious for causing hospital-acquired infections — can migrate from the gut into the bloodstream and eventually into the brain.

This bacterial invasion may lead to increased inflammation in the brain and impair cognitive functions, mimicking symptoms seen in Alzheimer’s patients.

The findings emphasize the potential risk hospital-acquired infections like K. pneumoniae may pose in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Credit: Neuroscience News

The work was published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

“Hospitalizations and ICU stays, combined with antibiotic exposure, may lead to a further decline in microbiome diversity that leaves older adults at high risk not only for digestive issues but also for extra-intestinal pathologies such as neurodegenerative disorders through a dysregulation of the gut-brain axis,” said Ravinder Nagpal, an assistant professor in the FSU College of Education, Health, and Human Sciences and the director of the Gut Biome Lab.

The study is the first to show a direct correlation between K. pneumoniae infection and Alzheimer’s pathology, fueling the emerging field that investigates how infectious agents may trigger or aggravate Alzheimer’s disease.

It also paves the way for future research into how to treat harmful infectious agents in vulnerable populations such as the elderly or those recovering from sepsis.

The research suggests that when antibiotics disrupt the gut, it can lead to issues not just in the gut but also in the brain. Using a preclinical mouse model, researchers showed that antibiotic exposure depletes gut bacterial diversity and causes microbiome imbalance, which promotes the proliferation of K. pneumoniae by creating a favorable niche.

When this happens, K. pneumoniae can move from the gut into the bloodstream by passing through the gut lining and eventually reach the brain, triggering neuroinflammation and neurocognitive impairment.

The findings emphasize the potential risk hospital-acquired infections like K. pneumoniae may pose in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

“Hospital-acquired and septic infections are one of the risk factors that may increase the predispositions to future neuroinflammatory and neurocognitive impairments, especially in older adults,” Nagpal said.

The study highlights the need for innovative therapeutic approaches to combat the rising prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease, in addition to existing amyloid and tau protein therapies. Further research could provide insight into preventive strategies aimed at managing hospital-acquired pathogens and preserving cognitive health in aging populations.

Funding: The research was funded by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Florida Department of Health.

“An Enteric Bacterial Infection Triggers Neuroinflammation and Neurobehavioral Impairment in 3xTg-AD Transgenic Mice” by Ravinder Nagpal et al. Journal of Infectious Diseases

Abstract

An Enteric Bacterial Infection Triggers Neuroinflammation and Neurobehavioral Impairment in 3xTg-AD Transgenic Mice

Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae is infamous for hospital-acquired infections and sepsis, which have also been linked to Alzheimer disease (AD)-related neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative impairment. However, its causative and mechanistic role in AD pathology remains unstudied.

Methods

A preclinical model of K. pneumoniae enteric infection and colonization is developed in an AD model (3xTg-AD mice) to investigate whether and how K. pneumoniae pathogenesis exacerbates neuropathogenesis via the gut-blood-brain axis.

Results

K. pneumoniae, particularly under antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, was able to translocate from the gut to the bloodstream by penetrating the gut epithelial barrier. Subsequently, K. pneumoniae infiltrated the brain by breaching the blood-brain barrier. Significant neuroinflammatory phenotype was observed in mice with K. pneumoniae brain infection. K. pneumoniae-infected mice also exhibited impaired neurobehavioral function and elevated total tau levels in the brain.

Metagenomic analyses revealed an inverse correlation of K. pneumoniae with gut biome diversity and commensal bacteria, highlighting how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis triggers an enteroseptic “pathobiome” signature implicated in gut-brain perturbations.

Conclusions

The findings demonstrate how infectious agents following hospital-acquired infections and consequent antibiotic regimen may induce gut dysbiosis and pathobiome and increase the risk of sepsis, thereby increasing the predisposition to neuroinflammatory and neurobehavioral impairments via breaching the gut-blood-brain barrier.",880,"alzheimers, study, brain, research, risk, infections, k, progression, linked, gut, pneumoniae, hospitalacquired, bacteria"
24,line attractor neural state signal neurons brain sexual activity mice,"Summary: New research has uncovered that brain signals for aggression in male mice and sexual arousal in female mice are encoded by similar neural mechanisms. The studies found that a specific type of neural signal, called a line attractor, represents the intensity and persistence of these emotional states.

In the case of aggression, this signal builds up over time and slowly decays after the stimulus is removed, resembling how humans calm down after anger. The findings suggest that different emotions may share common neural pathways, potentially offering insights into mental health treatments.

Key Facts:

Aggression and arousal in mice are both encoded by a neural “line attractor.”

These signals build up and persist over time, similar to human emotional states.

Findings may inform future treatments for emotional and mental health conditions.

Source: CalTech

A series of three papers from neuroscientist David J. Anderson’s laboratory, two in the journal Nature and one in the journal Cell, reveal new insights into the neural signals underlying internal emotional states including aggression and sexual arousal.

The studies show that the state of aggression in male mice and the state of arousal in female mice are both encoded by a common type of signal in the brain.

The shape of emotions

These findings are the result of collaborations within the group of Anderson, who is the Seymour Benzer Professor of Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Leadership Chair, and director of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience at Caltech.

The three new studies all build upon previous research from the Anderson lab, in particular a study published in Cell last year led by Computation and Neural Systems graduate student Aditya Nair, and former postdoctoral scholar Ann Kennedy, who is now an associate professor at the Scripps Research Institute.

In that study, researchers discovered a neural signal encoding the persistence and intensity of an internal state of aggression. Nair, who is also a co-first author on the two recent Nature papers and second author on the new Cell paper, used machine learning to model brain activity, which revealed that the neural signal causing the state of aggression in mice was a line attractor.

A line attractor is a specific pattern of activity, created by the interconnections between brain cells, that follows the shape of a valley. In a graph showing the flow of energy among neurons over time, the energy in a line attractor system tends to flow down the valley, like a ball rolling down into a trough. Once neural energy has reached the bottom, it tends to stay there and flow along a line, like a river moving along the bottom of a valley.

In the line attractor signal encoding aggression, the farther that neural energy flows along the line, the more the animal’s aggressive state escalates. Then after a fight, it takes time for the neural energy to flow back out of the valley. The researchers speculate that this gradual decay may correspond to the time it takes someone to calm down if they are very upset or angry.

Nair says this finding was unexpected because, while line attractors had been observed in the cortex and hippocampus (which are evolutionarily recent brain regions that control higher cognitive functions), many had assumed that the hypothalamus (an evolutionarily ancient region that controls instinctive behaviors) would not possess these types of signals.

The next challenges, says Nair, were “to really test our theory and see if this signal was indeed a property of the brain networks we were directly observing, to understand what mechanisms sustain this network, and to ask if this was unique to aggression or if it reflected a common principle for the brain to represent emotion states.”

The proof is in the hypothalamus

Because the original study was based on machine learning modeling, the researchers did not yet have evidence that the signal of escalating aggressiveness was encoded by local neural circuits.

While the researchers were observing activity in a specific region of the hypothalamus, it was possible the line attractor signal was being created in another brain region and passed along to the hypothalamus via long-range connections.

To answer that question, postdoctoral scholar Amit Vinograd and Nair performed a technically challenging “record and play back” type of experiment designed to test whether the neural signal could be reproduced in a laboratory setting by reactivating the right cells in mice brains.

This required that the researchers use sophisticated techniques to observe neural activity in the hypothalamus in real time while a mouse was in an aggressive state, identify which neurons contributed to the aggressiveness line attractor, and then restimulate those specific neurons to see whether the line attractor could be reproduced.

In other words, if an external stimulus caused the neural energy to flow into the valley, would directly stimulating the observed neurons push the system into the same valley as well? If so, it would imply that the line attractor could be generated locally by the neurons being observed and was not passively “inherited” from some other brain region.

“This experiment was one of those rare ‘movie moments’ you don’t get often in science and, to me, really showed the power of collaboration,” Nair says.

While the researchers used machine learning to model the neural data and locate the line attractor in the brain, they created a hologram of the specific neurons they needed to activate. Then, they used a laser to reactivate those neurons.

When the researchers artificially reactivated the individual neurons that were making up the line attractor signal, they observed that the cells “integrated” the activation inputs, gradually accumulating the new neural signals into a stronger, more persistent signal, which was the line attractor.

This accumulation could be compared to more water flowing into a river and pushing the river farther along the bottom of a valley.

“Once we saw that the signal was actually intrinsic in the network, we wanted to know how it was being created,” Vinograd says.

“So, then we did experiments to test the functional connectivity of neurons by activating single cells to see whether other cells in the network also light up. We saw what we call ‘recurrent connectivity,’ which means that a specific cell population—those that make up the line attractor—are interconnected to one another.

“This interconnectivity allows them to do this computation that integrates the information; the strength of connectivity increases because the cells are amplifying each other.”

This amplification is what creates the tendency of the energy to flow into the line attractor shape. The study marked the first direct experimental evidence of line attractor dynamics in a mammalian brain—something that was previously only theorized to exist.

The results are described in the paper “Causal evidence of a line attractor encoding an affective state,” published in Nature.

Neuropeptides facilitate the signal of aggressiveness

In another study published in Cell, researchers in the Anderson lab, led by postdoctoral scholar George Mountoufaris, found that the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin—brain chemicals important in social behavior and social learning—are necessary for the aggressiveness line attractor to form.

Building again upon prior studies from the lab, the researchers hypothesized that the aggressiveness signal, which persists for relatively longer than other brain signals, is implemented in neural circuits with the use of slow-acting chemical messengers including neuropeptides.

While many neural signals are implemented with the more common and fast-acting chemical messenger glutamate, neuropeptides like oxytocin and vasopressin can influence the activity of neural circuits with longer-lasting and wider-reaching effects in the brain.

To explore the role of these neuropeptides in implementing the signal of aggressiveness, Mountoufaris invented a new technique called “CRISPRoscopy,” which combines the gene-editing technology CRISPR with single-cell calcium imaging methods to record brain activity.

Using the technique, researchers disrupted specific neurons’ ability to detect oxytocin and vasopressin. They then observed the effect of this genetic disruption on both the animals’ social behavior and on their brain activity.

“While aggression was not completely abolished, the animals exhibited reduced aggression and fought with less vigor,” Mountoufaris says. “Without the signaling of oxytocin and vasopressin, the mice were unable to sustain the anger state required to escalate the aggression.”

Inside the brain, the disruption affected how long individual neurons, as well as populations of neurons, remained active once triggered by an aggression-promoting stimulus.

“The persistence of neural responses at the single-cell level was significantly diminished,” Mountoufaris says. “And the population-level activity was completely compromised.”

These findings showed that the line attractor did not form without the neuropeptide signaling, indicating that oxytocin and vasopressin play a critical role in the implementation of the aggressiveness signal.

Mountoufaris says this result was surprising and significant because most previous theoretical studies had discounted the role of such slow chemical messengers in generating line attractors.

The full study, “A line attractor encoding a persistent internal state requires neuropeptide signaling,” is published in Cell.

A neural signal of sexual arousal

While the hypothalamus in male mice has a line attractor encoding a signal of anger, a new study led by graduate alum Mengyu Liu (PhD ’24) and Nair found that the same region in female mice has a line attractor encoding sexual receptivity, which may generate an internal state of sexual arousal.

In a previous study led by Liu, researchers discovered a female-specific type of neuron within the hypothalamus that promotes sexual receptivity. Surprisingly, however, as females proceeded through their estrus cycle (which in mice lasts about a week), there was no change in the overall level of activity of these neurons whether the females were in their receptive or non-receptive phase.

To better understand the activity of the sexual receptivity-promoting cell population, Nair applied the same machine learning techniques to the female mouse data.

“We think of sexual arousal as an internal state, which has the same qualities as an aggressive state: persistence and intensity,” Nair says. “This gave us to opportunity to really ask if the line attractor we observed in aggression was specific to that state or was a common type of brain computation that is reused for different types of emotion states, including sexual arousal.”

This approach indeed revealed a line attractor encoding the signal of sexual receptivity in females. During the “receptive” stages of the estrus cycle, the arousal signal moved along the bottom of the valley in response to repeated sexual contact by male mice.

As male mice sniffed, mounted, and mated with female mice, the female mouse brains accumulated those inputs, and they were more likely to display receptive behavior in response to males.

“One surprising discovery is the gradual ramping up of sexual arousal in females during mating, which can occur over several minutes or even longer,” Liu says.

The authors speculate that this ramping and persistent neural activity (which flows in a similar pattern to the aggressiveness signal in males) may serve to keep the females “interested” in the male in between bouts of mounting, which are intermittent and sporadic.

The study also revealed that the mating line attractor was only observed during specific phases of the estrus cycle, when the females were sexually receptive. If females were mounted by males during the non-receptive phase of their cycle, the line attractor was not observed.

“We found that achieving this heightened state of arousal depends on being in the appropriate hormonal state,” says Liu.

“Without the right hormonal conditions, even repeated successful copulations—essentially nonconsensual encounters—may not lead to sexual arousal in the female.”

“Historically, scientific research has disproportionately focused on males, leaving female-specific biological questions largely underexplored,” Liu says.

“There are significant differences between the sexes in physiology and brain function, which limit women’s ability to fully benefit from male-centered scientific findings. Addressing this gap by prioritizing female subjects and questions is critical to advancing gender-inclusive science and improving women’s health.”

Liu says the findings of the study can ultimately guide research to inform health care providers and the public about the natural fluctuations in a woman’s emotional state during sexual experiences due to hormonal changes and may also provide justification for the development of hormone therapies aimed at improving sexual health in women.

The study is called “Encoding of female mating dynamics by a hypothalamic line attractor” and is published in Nature.

A shared language for encoding emotions

The three new studies reveal unique findings about how internal states of male aggressiveness and female sexual receptivity are implemented in the brain. The authors say these internal states likely exist in humans as well, where we may consciously perceive them as feelings that we call “anger” and “sexual arousal,” respectively.

Altogether, the studies suggest that the persistence and intensity of emotional states might be encoded by a common property of certain neural networks in the brain in the form of line attractors.

Because attractors are stable states of brain activity that are difficult to dispel once they form, it has been hypothesized that they may underlie certain types of long-lasting mental illness, such as depression.

“We’re very excited about what these findings could mean for mental health conditions,” Nair says. “All these studies use cutting-edge tools, which, when combined with machine learning, can unveil both how attractors might change with different disorders and how we might be able to intervene with mental health therapies.”

“These studies have opened up a new era of work in my laboratory using computational approaches,” says Anderson. While these approaches are a mainstay of research in other fields at Caltech, Anderson had not previously applied them to his own work.

“In the best tradition of Caltech,” Anderson says, “it was the expertise of a graduate student that brought this new approach to our research, with very exciting results and implications.”

Abstract

Causal evidence of a line attractor encoding an affective state

Continuous attractors are an emergent property of neural population dynamics that have been hypothesized to encode continuous variables such as head direction and eye position.

In mammals, direct evidence of neural implementation of a continuous attractor has been hindered by the challenge of targeting perturbations to specific neurons within contributing ensembles. Dynamical systems modelling has revealed that neurons in the hypothalamus exhibit approximate line-attractor dynamics in male mice during aggressive encounters.

We have previously hypothesized that these dynamics may encode the variable intensity and persistence of an aggressive internal state. Here we report that these neurons also showed line-attractor dynamics in head-fixed mice observing aggression. This allowed us to identify and manipulate line-attractor-contributing neurons using two-photon calcium imaging and holographic optogenetic perturbations.

On-manifold perturbations yielded integration of optogenetic stimulation pulses and persistent activity that drove the system along the line attractor, while transient off-manifold perturbations were followed by rapid relaxation back into the attractor. Furthermore, single-cell stimulation and imaging revealed selective functional connectivity among attractor-contributing neurons.

Notably, individual differences among mice in line-attractor stability were correlated with the degree of functional connectivity among attractor-contributing neurons. Mechanistic recurrent neural network modelling indicated that dense subnetwork connectivity and slow neurotransmission best recapitulate our empirical findings.

Our work bridges circuit and manifold levels, providing causal evidence of continuous attractor dynamics encoding an affective internal state in the mammalian hypothalamus.

Abstract

Encoding of female mating dynamics by a hypothalamic line attractor

Females exhibit complex, dynamic behaviours during mating with variable sexual receptivity depending on hormonal status. However, how their brains encode the dynamics of mating and receptivity remains largely unknown.

The ventromedial hypothalamus, ventrolateral subdivision contains oestrogen receptor type 1-positive neurons that control mating receptivity in female mice.

Here, unsupervised dynamical system analysis of calcium imaging data from these neurons during mating uncovered a dimension with slow ramping activity, generating a line attractor in neural state space.

Neural perturbations in behaving females demonstrated relaxation of population activity back into the attractor. During mating, population activity integrated male cues to ramp up along this attractor, peaking just before ejaculation.

Activity in the attractor dimension was positively correlated with the degree of receptivity. Longitudinal imaging revealed that attractor dynamics appear and disappear across the oestrus cycle and are hormone dependent.

These observations suggest that a hypothalamic line attractor encodes a persistent, escalating state of female sexual arousal or drive during mating.

They also demonstrate that attractors can be reversibly modulated by hormonal status, on a timescale of days.

Abstract

A line attractor encoding a persistent internal state requires neuropeptide signaling

Internal states drive survival behaviors, but their neural implementation is poorly understood. Recently, we identified a line attractor in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) that represents a state of aggressiveness.

Line attractors can be implemented by recurrent connectivity or neuromodulatory signaling, but evidence for the latter is scant.

Here, we demonstrate that neuropeptidergic signaling is necessary for line attractor dynamics in this system by using cell-type-specific CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing combined with single-cell calcium imaging.

Co-disruption of receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin in adult VMH Esr1+ neurons that control aggression diminished attack, reduced persistent neural activity, and eliminated line attractor dynamics while only slightly reducing overall neural activity and sex- or behavior-specific tuning.

These data identify a requisite role for neuropeptidergic signaling in implementing a behaviorally relevant line attractor in mammals.

Our approach should facilitate mechanistic studies in neuroscience that bridge different levels of biological function and abstraction.",2978,"arousal, encoded, brain, activity, state, signal, signals, neurons, sexual, mice, aggression, neural, line, reveal, attractor"
25,iud pain like says tatman procedure painful experience marpaung people,"While catching up with a friend, Mallory Tatman discovered they were both getting intrauterine device (IUD) insertions in the coming weeks.

Neither of them were worried about the procedure, as young women are increasingly turning to IUDs as a form of contraception. Even after her friend called from the doctor's office to express how painful it was, Tatman thought she was exaggerating. The Houston native always felt she had a high pain tolerance, and decided to record herself receiving the IUD as proof.

But, the experience that followed was jarring.

“I figured it would feel like a Pap smear, like a typical experience,"" she says. ""Well, (the doctor) went to insert the IUD, and it was the worst pain ever. It just felt like someone stabbed inside of me.”

Tatman later posted the video to TikTok to spread awareness of how painful these procedures can be.

She's not alone. Nicole Marpaung, 23, also went viral for sharing a recording of her IUD procedure on TikTok, accumulating 6.5 million views. In her comment section, other people commiserated over how their IUD insertions had brought the worst pain of their lives. ""They don't tell you how bad it is when you go to do it,"" one user wrote.

In August, the CDC released updated recommendations that encourage doctors to offer patients lidocaine and pain management tools during IUD insertions. But, Tatman believes there is still a long way to go to ensure no one has an experience like hers. These videos, she says, are a good way to start the discussion.

What is an IUD and why can getting one be painful?

An intrauterine device, or IUD, is a tiny device that is inserted into your uterus to prevent pregnancy. IUDs are divided into two types: hormonal IUDs and copper IUDs.

IUDs are long-acting reversible contraceptives and are one of the most effective, mistake-proof methods of birth control. They are also more than 99% effective as emergency contraception when inserted within five days after unprotected sex.

To insert an IUD, a doctor will put a speculum into the vagina, and then use a special inserter (a small tube) to pass the IUD through the cervical opening and into the uterus.

What is an IUD?Answering the birth control questions you were too afraid to ask

Some people won't feel any pain with the procedure and others will, according to Dr. Franziska Haydanek, an OBGYN and online health educator.

Everyone's experience is different, and women who have had vaginal births, particularly in the past two years, are less likely to experience pain during IUD placement. If someone's cervix is tightly closed, having the IUD inserter go through will be more painful. And, when the IUD is deployed (opened into the uterus), it can touch the top of the uterus and cause uterine cramping for some patients.

Why people are posting their IUD experiences online

Marpaung had originally recorded the video for herself but later wanted to bring attention to these painful procedures by sharing her experience online. Tatman was left confused after her procedure and wanted to know if other people had experienced the same thing.

""I couldn't believe I went through that amount of pain,"" Tatman says. ""But most of my comments were just about how painful it is. It's an old video, but I still get comments asking questions, like, 'I'm about to get mine. How bad does it hurt?'""

Before the release of August's updated CDC practice recommendations, the most up-to-date information was from the CDC's 2016 report. Previously, doctors were not encouraged to offer pain medication to patients receiving IUDs, leaving people in the dark about how to manage their care and reduce discomfort going into the procedure.

Marpaung says she asked about the pain beforehand, and her doctor said it would just be uncomfortable, not painful.

""I didn't realize what the procedure was like,"" she says. ""They brought out this clamp to dilate my cervix. And then they have this scissor thing that clamps right at my uterus, but it literally looks like a medieval torture device.""

That device is the tenaculum, a tool with two hooked ends that holds the cervix in place as the uterus is measured and the IUD is placed.

Marpaung began cramping ""immediately,"" but the doctor was ""downplaying"" her pain while trying to keep her calm. ""After the procedure, I didn't even have five minutes after they put it in me (to recover),"" she says. ""They were like, 'Alright. You're all set, bye.'""

She had to take the rest of the day off work and felt too ill to drive home.

Videos like Tatman and Marpaung's can serve as a ""warning"" ahead of the procedure, and provide a space for people to ask each other questions and offer support — both posts have tens of thousands of comments.

But these first-hand accounts can also lead to anxiety for viewers before their own procedures. Haydanek says that while raising awareness through social media is a positive thing, information received online should be discussed with your doctor.

""Otherwise, you're taking lay people's words and experiences as facts, and it may not be what is medically true, or what is true to you as the patient in the situation,"" she says.

Will updated CDC recommendations be enough to provide relief?

According to Haydanek, providers can be informed of updated CDC recommendations for any topic through continuing medical education each year, conferences and medical journals. However, offering pain control is not required.

Haydanek says that pain control should be discussed with patients ahead of time so that they're given all of their options. However, Tatman and Marpaung want lidocaine to be required, not suggested, for every IUD procedure.

""Do it for everyone so no one will have to experience that,"" Marpaung says. ""It's an unnecessary pain.""

In the reality show ""The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,"" several of the cast members received laughing gas (nitrous oxide) before getting Botox. At a dentist's office near Tatman, the same drugs are offered for routine visits: ""I'm like, 'OK you're getting laughing gas for getting your teeth cleaned' ... It's very backwards. I don't understand it.""

""In women's health, trying to get anything that's not traditionally offered is the hardest thing,"" Tatman says. ""There should be a pre-care, during-care and after-care, like a whole policy that should be followed when getting an IUD, just like any other procedure.""",1067,"doctor, agonizing, updated, procedure, birth, painful, control, tatman, pain, went, iud, common, recommendations, experience, uterus, problem, getting, left"

Using stem cells generated from patients with a rare and severe form of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, Scripps Research scientists have grown personalized “mini-brains” (or organoids) to study the disorder in new detail.

The lab-grown organoids allowed the team to gain a new understanding of how one genetic mutation leads to autism spectrum disorder. It also showed that an experimental drug, called NitroSynapsin, reversed some of the brain dysfunction associated with autism in these models.

Since ASD is generally not diagnosed during fetal brain development, treatments that aim to alter initial development—such as correction of a mutated gene or addition of miRNA molecules to stop the imbalance of cell types—are not currently feasible. Credit: Neuroscience News

“Our work shows how this genetic mutation that has been associated with autism, disrupts the typical balance of brain cells during development,” says Stuart A. Lipton, MD, Ph.D., Step Family Foundation Endowed Professor and co-director of the Neurodegeneration New Medicines Center at Scripps Research, a clinical neurologist, and senior author of the new research published online in Molecular Psychiatry on September 30, 2024.

“But we’ve also established that there could be ways to address this imbalance later in life.”

Learning from patients

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects social interactions, repetitive interests and behaviors, and communication. The causes of ASD are only partially known; a number of genetic variants have been associated with the disorder, but each only explain a tiny percentage of cases.

For many years, studies of ASD have revolved around modeling the disorder in mice or studying isolated human brain cells. Neither is a perfect mimic for the complexity of an interconnected human brain.

Lipton and his colleagues focused on MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome (MHS), a rare and severe form of ASD and intellectual disability caused by a genetic variation in the MEF2C gene.

They used skin cells isolated from patients with MHS and used modern stem cell biology techniques to transform those cells into human stem cells, and then grew them into small, millimeter-sized “mini-brain” organoids in which the researchers could study how the various types of brain cells interact with each other.

“We could reproduce essential aspects of the brains of patients to study their electrical activity and other properties,” says Lipton.

“We actually brought kids into the lab to see their own mini-brains and that was quite emotional for the children and families alike.”

In healthy human brains and brain organoids, neural stem cells develop into nerve cells (or neurons), which send and receive messages throughout the brain, as well as into various types of glial cells, which are supportive cells recently shown to be important in signaling and in immune function.

Healthy brains contain a balance of excitatory neurons that promote electrical signaling, and inhibitory neurons that block this signaling. Autism causes an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance, often resulting in too much excitation.

In the organoids developed from the cells of children with MHS, the neural stem cells more often developed into glial cells, causing a disproportionate number of glial cells compared to neurons, Lipton’s group found. In particular, the MHS organoids had fewer inhibitory neurons than usual. This led to excessive electrical signaling in the mini-brains, just like many real human brains with ASD.

A role for microRNA

When Lipton’s group probed exactly how MEF2C mutations could lead to this imbalance between cell types, they found nearly 200 genes that were directly controlled by the MEF2C gene. Three of these genes stood out—rather than encoding for DNA that led to messenger (m)RNA and then protein expression, they encoded genes for microRNA molecules.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that, rather than producing proteins themselves, bind to DNA to control gene expression. This month, two scientists won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work describing the discovery of miRNA molecules and how they can impact cell development and behavior.

“In our study, a few specific miRNAs appear to be important in telling developing brain cells whether to become glial cells, excitatory neurons, or inhibitory neurons,” says Lipton.

“Mutations in MEFC2 alter the expression of these miRNAs which, in turn, prevent the developing brain from making proper nerve cells and proper connections or synapses between nerve cells.”

Early, developing brain cells from patients with MHS, Lipton’s group found, have lower levels of three specific miRNAs. When the researchers added extra copies of these miRNA molecules to the patient-derived brain organoids, the mini-brains developed more normally, with a standard balance of neurons and glial cells.

A potential treatment

Since ASD is generally not diagnosed during fetal brain development, treatments that aim to alter initial development—such as correction of a mutated gene or addition of miRNA molecules to stop the imbalance of cell types—are not currently feasible.

However, Lipton was already developing another drug that could help promote the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, even after development.

Lipton’s group recently tested such a drug, which he and colleagues invented and patented under the name NitroSynapsin (aka EM-036), for its ability to restore brain connections in “mini-brains” made from cells affected by Alzheimer’s disease.

In the new paper, they tested whether the drug could also help treat the MHS form of autism. Using the patient-derived brain organoids, Lipton and his colleagues showed that in fully developed brain organoids that had an imbalance between cell types, NitroSynapsin could partially correct the imbalance, preventing the hyperexcitability of the neurons and restoring excitatory/inhibitory balance in the mini-brain. This also protected the nerve cell connections or synapses.

More work is needed to show whether the drug improves symptoms of patients with MHS, or influences other types of autism spectrum disorder that are not caused by mutations in the MEF2C gene. Lipton says he hypothesizes this could be the case, since MEF2C is known to influence many other genes associated with autism.

“We are continuing to test this drug in animal models with the aim of getting it into people in the near future,” says Lipton. “This is an exciting step in that direction.”

“Dysregulation of miRNA expression and excitation in MEF2C autism patient hiPSC-neurons and cerebral organoids” by Stuart A. Lipton et al. Molecular Psychiatry

Abstract

Dysregulation of miRNA expression and excitation in MEF2C autism patient hiPSC-neurons and cerebral organoids

MEF2C is a critical transcription factor in neurodevelopment, whose loss-of-function mutation in humans results in MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome (MHS), a severe form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)/intellectual disability (ID).

Despite prior animal studies of MEF2C heterozygosity to mimic MHS, MHS-specific mutations have not been investigated previously, particularly in a human context as hiPSCs afford.

Here, for the first time, we use patient hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and cerebral organoids to characterize MHS deficits. Unexpectedly, we found that decreased neurogenesis was accompanied by activation of a micro-(mi)RNA-mediated gliogenesis pathway.

We also demonstrate network-level hyperexcitability in MHS neurons, as evidenced by excessive synaptic and extrasynaptic activity contributing to excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance.

Notably, the predominantly extrasynaptic (e)NMDA receptor antagonist, NitroSynapsin, corrects this aberrant electrical activity associated with abnormal phenotypes.

During neurodevelopment, MEF2C regulates many ASD-associated gene networks, suggesting that treatment of MHS deficits may possibly help other forms of ASD as well.",1348,"insights, autism, brain, cells, mhs, cell, research, disorder, imbalance, minibrains, neurons, organoids, mef2c, stem, unlock"
27,supernova star pa 30 nebula researchers remnant astronomers map explosion,"The nebula Pa 30 is the remnant of a powerful supernova that created a ""guest star"" spotted by Astronomers in the 12th Century. At its heart lies an undead white dwarf star.

A first-of-its-kind, animated map has revealed fresh secrets about a mysterious, flowering ""zombie star"" lurking in the remnant of a supernova that lit up Earth's skies more than 800 years ago. The ""3D movie"" shows that the remains of the stellar explosion are unusually wonky and are still exploding at a constant speed.

In 1181, astronomers in China and Japan spotted a new star shining near the constellation Cassiopeia. Historical records of this ""guest star"" show that the bright spot persisted for around six months, from August of that year until February 1182.

Today, researchers know that the stellar imposter was actually a powerful supernova, or exploding star, known as SN 1181. However, its origin remained a mystery until 2021, when astronomers finally confirmed that the supernova came from the nebula Pa 30 — a giant cloud of gas wider than our entire solar system.

Previous observations of Pa 30 revealed a white dwarf star at the center of the nebula. The superdense object is all that remains of the exploding star that lit up the night sky 843 years ago. It burns intensely at around 360,000 degrees Fahrenheit (200,000 degrees Celsius), making it one of the hottest stars in the known universe . Normally, exploding stars get completely ripped apart when they go supernova, which makes this type of remnant a rarity.

In a new study, released Thursday (Oct. 24) in The Astrophysical Journal Letters , astronomers created a new map of Pa 30 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) — a spectrograph located near the summit of Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano.

The resulting image was extremely detailed, capturing large filaments resembling ""the petals of a dandelion"" extending from the white dwarf to the edge of the nebula, the researchers wrote in a statement sent to Live Science.

By analyzing how the light given off by Pa 30 has shifted over time, the KCWI also traced how the nebula has changed shape, thus allowing the researchers to simulate a mini ""3D movie"" of the nebula's history. This is the first time this has ever been done with a supernova remnant, the researchers wrote.

One of the key takeaways from the animation is that the nebula is expanding at around 2.2 million mph (3.5 million km/h), which is around the same speed it would have hurled out debris during the initial supernova. ""This means that the ejected material has not been slowed down, or sped up, since the explosion,"" study lead author Tim Cunningham , an astrophysicist at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said in the statement.

Pa 30 is unusually asymmetrical and researchers have no clear idea why. (Image credit: Walter Scott Houston)

Using this rate of expansion to look back in time, the team was able to ""pinpoint the explosion to almost exactly the year 1181,"" which provided further proof that the guest star observed by astronomers back then came from Pa 30, Cunningham added.

The map also shows that Pa 30 is surprisingly asymmetrical compared with similar supernova remnants. There is no clear explanation for why the nebula would have grown wonky since the supernova, suggesting the asymmetry was caused by the initial explosion, the researchers wrote. However, it is unclear how this happened.",666,"pa, star, flowering, ago, heart, zombie, nebula, researchers, astronomers, supernova, lit, skies, 30, exploding, earths, map, explosion, remnant"
28,solar flare flares sun magnetic study polito nature astronomy said,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Observations of active regions associated to the flare. Credit: Nature Astronomy (2024). DOI: 10.1038/s41550-024-02396-4

An international collaboration that includes an Oregon State University astrophysicist has identified a phenomenon, likened to the quick-footed movements of an iconic cartoon predator, that proves a 19-year-old theory regarding how solar flares are created.

Findings of the study led by Juraj Lorincik of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute were published in Nature Astronomy.

Understanding solar flares is important for predicting space weather and mitigating how it affects technology and human activities, said Vanessa Polito, a courtesy faculty member in OSU's College of Science.

""Solar flares can release a tremendous amount of energy—10 million times greater than the energy released from a volcanic eruption,"" Polito said. ""Flares and associated coronal mass ejections can drive beautiful aurorae but also severely affect our space environment, disrupt communications, pose hazards to astronauts and satellites in space, and affect the power grid on Earth.""

The ""slip-running"" reconnections of the sun's magnetic field lines—the term was inspired by Wile E. Coyote's mad scrambles after the Road Runner—were observed via NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, or IRIS, a satellite used to study the sun's atmosphere.

The observation of tiny, brilliant features in the atmosphere of the sun moving at unprecedented speeds—thousands of kilometers per second—opens the door to a deeper understanding of the creation of solar flares, the most powerful explosions in the solar system.

Guillaume Aulanier of the Paris Observatory, a collaborator on the research, developed the slip-running reconnection concept in 2005.

But measuring the speed of solar flare kernels had been elusive, Polito said. Kernels are small, bright regions within the larger flare ribbons that mark the location of magnetic field reconnection, areas known as footpoints where intense heat and energy release occur.

However, recently designed high-cadence observing programs, which capture images about every two seconds, revealed the slipping motions of kernels moving at speeds of up to 2,600 kilometers per second.

""The tiny, bright features observed by IRIS trace the very fast motion of footpoints of individual magnetic field lines, which slip along the solar atmosphere during a flare,"" said Polito, the deputy principal investigator of the IRIS mission.

""Flares and magnetic reconnection are phenomena that occur in all stars and in different astrophysical objects throughout the universe, such as pulsars and black holes. On the sun, our closest star, we can study them in great detail as demonstrated by our study.""

A solar flare occurs when the sun's atmosphere emits a sudden, intense burst of radiation via the rapid release of built-up magnetic energy. The energy output of a single flare is equivalent to millions of hydrogen bombs exploding simultaneously and covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays.

Flares are often associated with large expulsions of plasma—gas so hot that electrons are separated from nuclei—from the sun's corona, phenomena known as coronal mass ejections. A flare can last from minutes to hours.

Joining Polito, Lorincik and Aulanier on the study were scientists representing the Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory, where the IRIS satellite is operated.

CNN —

When dinosaurs roamed Earth, their surroundings looked very different than the world of today. But there were also some similarities. And now scientists have confirmed a new one: Diverse firefly species lit up the night during the late Mesozoic.

The discovery comes from a fossil of an ancient firefly species that was initially discovered in 2016, trapped in 99 million-year-old Burmese amber from northern Myanmar. The beetle is only the second firefly species from the Mesozoic to be identified.

Scientists estimated that fireflies evolved aerial bioluminescence, the ability to glow during flight, at least 100 million years ago in a July 2022 study that analyzed the first Mesozoic firefly fossil that was described in 2015. But because firefly remains from this period can be difficult to come by since the insects’ softer bodies don’t preserve well in the fossil record, the evolution of the beetles and their bioluminescence has been difficult to pinpoint, experts say.

The recently identified species, dubbed Flammarionella hehaikuni, could help researchers better understand the early evolution of fireflies and this characteristic trait, according to a study published September 11 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.

“The fossil helps bridge gaps in understanding the evolutionary history of the lampyroid beetles (the beetle family fireflies belong to) and shows that key traits, like abdominal light organs, have remained consistent since the mid-Cretaceous,” said lead study author Chenyang Cai, professor at Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in an email.

Fireflies in the land of dinosaurs

Upon first look of the firefly fossil in 2016, Cai said he thought the beetle was a type of click beetle in the Elateridae family — similar to a separate species Cai also helped to identify from Burmese amber in 2021 — due to the fossilized insect’s unique serrate antennae that modern fireflies do not have. But when he revisited the peculiar fossil described in the new study in late 2022, Cai noticed the well-preserved light organ, a characteristic of fireflies.

There are 10 past firefly species that are only known from fossils, said Dr. Oliver Keller, a research museum collection specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has studied the systematics and taxonomy of fireflies.

“The significance of this discovery is in the rarity of fossils of fireflies from that period,” Keller said via email. Because only one other Cretaceous firefly species has been identified, “this new species can be used to revisit the (July 2022 study) to better date the evolution of fireflies given the new evidence,” he added. Keller was not part of the new study or the 2022 research.

Fireflies glow for a multitude of reasons, most commonly as a defense mechanism and a way to communicate and attract mates. While it is hard to speculate how the flashes would have looked 100 million years ago, it is possible they would have looked similar to those seen today, Keller said.

The study authors named the beetle as a homage to French astronomer Camille Flammarion and Haikun He, an amateur collector who had donated several other amber specimens to the authors, according to the study.

Firefly diversity

There are more than 2,000 firefly species found today, according to the Natural History Museum in London. The study authors hypothesize that the newly reported ancient firefly species belonged to the Luciolinae, a subfamily that currently includes about 450 species, due to the placement of the light organ on the insect’s abdomen, said study coauthor Dr. Robin Kundrata, an entomologist and an associate professor in the department of zoology at the Palacký University Olomouc in the Czech Republic.

However, no existing Luciolinae species sports the peculiar antennae that the fossil had, which the authors suspect would also differ depending on the sex of the insect, according to the study. The newly identified fossil is that of a female.

What’s more, the firefly fossil, which measures less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) long, is morphologically different from the other specimen identified in 2015, showing that the light organs of Mesozoic species were more diverse than once thought but still similar to ones in modern fireflies, Kundrata said in an email.

The authors said they hope more firefly fossils from the Mesozoic will come to light to further scientists’ understanding of the mysterious origins of the bioluminescent beetles.

“Based on the recent knowledge, fireflies originated in the Mesozoic Era although the more precise period of their origin remains unclear. … Future discoveries may reveal further information on their diversity and morphology,” Kundrata said. “Since there is no information about the immature stages of fireflies from their early evolution, we would be happy for discoveries of fossil larval specimens from Mesozoic.”",846,"reveals, dinosaurs, study, authors, similar, light, species, mesozoic, previously, flickered, beetle, fireflies, undiscovered, firefly, fossil"

At the heart of this cosmic revelation lies Palomar 5, a stellar stream stretching across 30,000 light-years of space. Located approximately 80,000 light-years from Earth, this celestial wonder has captured the attention of scientists worldwide. Unlike typical globular clusters, Palomar 5 exhibits a unique characteristic : a long, sprawling river of stars that spans more than 20 degrees of the sky.

Researchers, led by astrophysicist Mark Gieles from the University of Barcelona, have meticulously studied Palomar 5 using advanced N-body simulations. These simulations recreate the orbits and evolutions of individual stars within the cluster, offering a glimpse into their cosmic journey. The results have been nothing short of astounding.

The team's findings suggest that Palomar 5 harbors an unexpected treasure trove : a swarm of over 100 stellar-mass black holes. This discovery challenges previous assumptions about the composition of globular clusters and opens up new avenues for understanding the formation of stellar streams.

Black holes : The architects of stellar streams

The presence of black holes within Palomar 5 appears to play a crucial role in shaping its unique structure. Gravitational interactions between stars and black holes act as cosmic slingshots, propelling stars out of the cluster and into the tidal stream. This process occurs more efficiently for stars than for black holes, gradually altering the cluster's composition.

Remarkably, the simulations revealed that black holes make up more than 20 percent of Palomar 5's total mass. This proportion is approximately three times higher than initially expected based on the cluster's stellar population. Each of these black holes boasts a mass of about 20 times that of our Sun, originating from supernova explosions during the cluster's early stages.

The implications of this discovery extend far beyond Palomar 5. Scientists now believe that other globular clusters may share a similar fate, eventually dissolving into stellar streams. This revelation provides valuable insights into the life cycle of these cosmic structures and their role in shaping our galaxy.

A cosmic Rosetta Stone

Palomar 5's unique characteristics make it an invaluable tool for understanding the formation and evolution of stellar streams. As Gieles explains, ""Palomar 5 is the only case, making it a Rosetta Stone for understanding stream formation."" This celestial oddity offers astronomers a rare opportunity to study the mechanisms behind these cosmic rivers in unprecedented detail.

The research team's simulations paint a fascinating picture of Palomar 5's future. In approximately one billion years, the cluster is predicted to dissolve completely. Just before this final act, the cluster's remnants will consist entirely of black holes, silently orbiting the galactic center.

This finding has significant implications for our understanding of black hole swarms detected in ancient star clusters in the Milky Way. It suggests that globular clusters may be prime locations for observing black hole collisions and searching for elusive intermediate-mass black holes.

Implications for future research

The discovery of this black hole swarm in Palomar 5 opens up exciting new avenues for astronomical research. Here are some key areas that scientists are eager to explore further :

The role of black holes in shaping galactic structures

The formation and evolution of stellar streams

The potential for detecting gravitational waves from black hole mergers

The search for intermediate-mass black holes

As our understanding of these cosmic phenomena grows, so too does our appreciation for the complexity and beauty of our universe. The Palomar 5 discovery serves as a testament to the power of advanced simulations and observational techniques in unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has unveiled the first images from its Compact Coronagraph (CCOR-1), the world’s first operational space-based coronagraph.

Mounted on the newly launched GOES-19 satellite, CCOR-1 began its mission on September 19, 2024, providing continuous views of the sun's corona, the outermost layer of the solar atmosphere. This telescope is a major advancement in space weather monitoring, offering real-time data that will improve the prediction of coronal mass ejections (CMEs)—powerful solar storms that can have significant impacts on Earth.

CCOR-1: A Breakthrough in Solar Monitoring

NOAA's CCOR-1 represents a groundbreaking leap in the monitoring of solar activity. The telescope uses a technique called coronagraphy, where an occulting disk blocks the intense light from the sun’s surface, allowing it to capture images of the much fainter corona. This is where CMEs, massive bursts of plasma and magnetic fields, originate. These eruptions are of great interest to scientists because they can affect Earth’s magnetic field, causing geomagnetic storms that disrupt satellites, GPS systems, and even power grids.

The first images captured by CCOR-1 show a coronal mass ejection emerging from the sun’s surface. Describing the event, James Spann, chief scientist at NOAA's Office of Space Weather Observations, explained, “The smoky cloud coming off the left-hand side of the center in the image is a coronal mass ejection... an explosion on the surface of the sun that literally expels part of its atmosphere outwards.” These CMEs are composed of plasma, a superheated mixture of electrons and protons, and can travel at speeds of hundreds to thousands of miles per second.

One of the key innovations of CCOR-1 is its ability to provide images every 15 minutes, offering near real-time monitoring of the sun's activity. This high-frequency data stream represents a significant improvement over previous instruments, which often had long gaps between reports. As Spann noted, continuous observation is crucial for early warning of solar storms: “The aurora is kind of like the icing on the cake, the most visible manifestation of space weather, but there are other impacts that are not so obvious.” These impacts include communication disruptions, GPS interference, and risks to astronauts in space.

The Importance of Real-time Space Weather Forecasting

The real-time data provided by CCOR-1 will play a crucial role in improving space weather forecasting. Space weather refers to the conditions in space, particularly the behavior of solar winds and CMEs, that can affect Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere. When a CME is directed towards Earth, it can create geomagnetic storms that have wide-ranging consequences. For example, these storms can induce electrical currents in power lines, potentially damaging transformers and causing power outages. Additionally, satellites and communication networks can be disrupted, with significant implications for industries reliant on GPS, aviation, and maritime navigation.

By monitoring solar activity every 15 minutes, CCOR-1 ensures that NOAA can detect CMEs as they happen and predict their potential impacts on Earth. Spann emphasized that while auroras are the most visible effect of these storms, their unseen impacts can be far more dangerous: “Satellites and communication networks can be interrupted when a CME heads our way and can even pose a risk to astronauts on space stations.” Given the increasing reliance on satellite technologies, early detection of these solar storms is more important than ever.

A Future of Enhanced Solar Monitoring

NOAA’s deployment of CCOR-1 is just the beginning of an ambitious plan to enhance space weather forecasting. The GOES-19 satellite, currently undergoing post-launch testing, will assume its full operational role as the GOES East satellite in 2025, providing continuous coverage of solar activity from its position in geostationary orbit. CCOR-1’s data will be integrated into NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center, where scientists will use it to forecast space weather events and issue warnings to protect critical infrastructure on Earth.

NOAA also plans to expand its solar monitoring capabilities with additional coronagraphs, as part of its Space Weather Follow-On and Space Weather Next programs. These initiatives will place similar instruments both along the sun-Earth line and in orbit around the sun, creating a comprehensive network of solar observatories that can track CMEs from multiple angles. By doing so, NOAA aims to provide even more accurate and timely forecasts, ensuring that space weather’s impacts on Earth are minimized.

Spann highlighted the significance of these advancements, noting that previous coronagraphs sometimes left gaps of several hours in their coverage. CCOR-1 and its future counterparts will close these gaps, enabling scientists to monitor the sun's activity continuously and improve their understanding of how space weather events unfold.

The Critical Role of Space Weather Monitoring

As space-based technologies continue to advance and space exploration becomes more frequent, the need for accurate space weather forecasting has never been more pressing. Solar storms, particularly CMEs, pose serious risks not only to satellites but also to power grids and communication infrastructure on Earth. With increasing reliance on GPS navigation, satellite communications, and other technologies, the potential damage from a major geomagnetic storm could be catastrophic.

NOAA’s deployment of CCOR-1 represents a critical step forward in protecting Earth from these risks. By providing continuous, real-time monitoring of the sun’s activity, this new instrument will allow scientists to issue early warnings and help mitigate the impacts of solar storms before they reach Earth. The ongoing development of additional coronagraphs will further strengthen these efforts, ensuring that space weather monitoring remains at the forefront of global preparedness.",906,"monitoring, cmes, space, groundbreaking, weather, views, ccor1, impacts, telescope, earth, suns, delivers, solar, jawdropping, storms"
32,radio frb astronomers detected pulse bursts 20190203 fast dispersion burst,"This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility:

Searching for pulsars using the Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope, Russian astronomers have detected a bright pulse at a frequency of 111 MHz, which appears to be a fast radio burst event. The finding was reported in a research paper published October 17 on the pre-print server arXiv.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense bursts of radio emission lasting milliseconds showcasing the characteristic dispersion sweep of radio pulsars. The physical nature of these bursts is yet unknown, and astronomers consider a variety of explanations ranging from synchrotron maser emission from young magnetars in supernova remnants to cosmic string cusps.

In general, FRBs are individual pulses with widths from 0.08 to 26 milliseconds and their dispersion measures usually range from 109 to 2,600 pc/cm3. Among the instruments capable of detecting pulses with such properties is LPA—one of the most sensitive radio telescopes operating at meter wavelengths.

Recently, a team of astronomers led by Sergey Tyul'bashev of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory in Russia, have detected an interesting pulse that may be an FRB. The discovery was made as part of the Pushchino Multibeams Pulsar Search (PUMPS) project, during a technical assessment of the quality of observations carried out with LPA of the Lebedev Physical Institute (LPI).

The discovered pulse lasted 211 milliseconds, had a dispersion measure of approximately 134.4 pc/cm3 and a peak flux density at a level of 20 Jy. The large dispersion measure of the pulse suggests its extragalactic origin and corresponds to a luminosity distance of about 2.3 billion light years.

According to the paper, the obtained properties indicate that the observed pulse is one of the most powerful fast radio bursts and the astronomers designated it FRB 20190203. The astronomers note that so far, no repeated radio bursts from FRB 20190203 have been detected, nor any activity has been observed in the gamma-ray range.

If the nature of FRB 20190203 is confirmed, it will make it the first burst of extragalactic origin discovered in the PUMPS survey. It is also the second FRB detected at such a low frequency (111 MHz), and the first one among non-repeating FRBs.

When it comes to the origin of FRB 20190203, the authors of the study propose the synchrotron maser emission scenario.

""In our opinion, the observed properties of FRB 20190203 are best explained by the model of a synchrotron maser source excited by a magnetar,"" the researchers conclude.

34,hopkins said chiefs good playing play contender deandre traded kansas,"New Chiefs WR DeAndre Hopkins explains the importance of him being traded to a contending team. (0:27)

Open Extended Reactions

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- DeAndre Hopkins has three first-team All-Pro selections and seven 1,000-yard receiving seasons. He has played on some good teams but never one that ventured deep in the playoffs.

So Hopkins says he is looking forward to playing for a Super Bowl contender after his trade to the Kansas City Chiefs was made official Thursday.

""I've done a lot, all the accolades that I can accomplish as far as personal [goals],"" Hopkins said before he joined the Chiefs at practice for the first time. ""So I think just playing meaningful football in January is what's left on the list.""

Hopkins thanked Tennessee Titans general manager Ran Carthon and his staff for sending him to a contender, saying, ""Those guys could have traded me anywhere.""

""It means a lot,"" Hopkins said. ""[Playing for a contender] takes your game to a different level. It [raises] your focus, your drive, knowing that you're playing for something.""

Coach Andy Reid indicated that the Chiefs planned for Hopkins to play Sunday against the Raiders in Las Vegas, saying 'Why wait?"" when asked about the possibility.

Hopkins said he would be ready if asked to play.

""I've been in the NFL for 12 years, so I know football,"" Hopkins said. ""Hopefully I can go out there and make some plays wherever I fit, wherever I'm needed.""

The Chiefs have lost two of their top wide receivers, Rashee Rice and Hollywood Brown, for lengthy periods, if not the season. JuJu Smith-Schuster won't play against the Raiders because of a sore hamstring, and Skyy Moore was placed on injured reserve Thursday.

""He's a good, veteran player and has seen just about everything over 12 years, and he's a good space player so he has a very good understanding how to work in space at the same time,"" Reid said of Hopkins. ""He's a tough matchup because of his size, arm length, big body that knows how to play that in low post area very well.""

Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy said Hopkins has a large catch radius, something that will help quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

""He has really, really good hands."" Nagy said. ""He's got some of the least amount of drops in the history of the NFL.""",391,"chiefs, good, space, wants, deandre, hes, playoff, deep, hopkins, saying, run, traded, contender, playing, trade, play"
35,nba embiid season sixers investigation league game thursday news plans,"On Thursday, a source told CBS Sports, the NBA's investigation into the participation of Philadelphia 76ers superstar Joel Embiid was underway.

The news came after he and teammate Paul George missed their nationally televised opener against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. Philly, without its two stars, lost to fellow Eastern Conference contenders 124-109.

Embiid's absence is a headline-grabbing moment early in this NBA season. The idea being Embiid is under the microscope of the NBA's watchful eye after missing such a notable game without an obvious injury -- on the heels, no less, of saying he may not play back-to-backs this season.

It's also, in the proper context, probably best summed up as: Big freaking deal.

The NBA is looking into Embiid's injury, his status, and his and the Sixers' plans for him this season. But it is also true that, across the league and within the Sixers organization, there were eyerolls at the bated-breath responses that followed.

That's because it's standard operating procedure to trigger an investigation when a star player misses a nationally televised game. Everyone knew this was coming, from Embiid's absence this first week to the fact the NBA would inevitably look into it.

It was news, just not a shock by any means.

There is nothing to be read into this news about, say, the NBA acting more aggressively or forcefully toward the Sixers than it would any other team in a similar situation.

Still, on Wednesday, there was an idea the Sixers were already under investigation before the season began. In the hours before the game, somewhat exasperated or bemused, sources pointed out that the game hadn't started yet, and Embiid hadn't yet officially missed, along with teammate George, the ESPN-broadcasted game.

No investigation could happen until after tipoff.

Wait for Thursday, sources said.

And so, like clockwork, on Thursday morning, the investigation that was always inevitable arrived. This will be like others before it: The NBA will try to understand what is happening, be open to the possibility Embiid is, in fact, injured, inquire about his and the Sixers' plans for him this season, with an eye toward his earlier comments on playing back-to-backs, and respond in kind.

Maybe with a fine. Maybe with nothing at all.

It's a story, yes, of course, but it's far from surprising. This was certain from the moment we knew Embiid would likely miss time this season.

There are interesting questions about Embiid's plans, a load-management-possible approach this season in a league clamping down on such moves, and to what degree the NBA will apply pressure, or not, if the Sixers routinely sit their injury-plagued superstar big man.

The NBA and players union are in Year 2 of an agreement in which NBA awards require a minimum threshold of 65 games played. Commissioner Adam Silver wants players to play, which is why there's a league participation policy and the understanding these situations will almost always be looked into.

The Embiid investigation isn't some earth-shattering information bomb that indicates a schism between the league and the Sixers, nor a surprising twist in this young NBA season. It's the new normal. And everyone, from Embiid to the Sixers to the league office, knew it was coming days ago.

36,dodgers yankees series game postseason ohtani judge plate two get,"The largest markets. The hugest stars. A renewal of the most frequently competed World Series.

Broadway vs. Hollywood. Aaron Judge vs. Shohei Ohtani. Yankees vs. Dodgers.

This is just about as Classic as the Fall gets, particularly once you throw in Gerrit Cole, Juan Soto, Giancarlo Stanton, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman.

These two teams will have played against each other in 10 percent of the 120 World Series. Of the 12, this will be the fifth since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the first overall since 1981. This represents the first matchup of top seeds in each league in a 162-game season since 2013 (Cardinals-Red Sox).

6 Yankees ace Gerrit Cole. Jason Szenes for the NY Post

The Yankees are going for their record 28th championship, but first since 2009. The Dodgers are in the World Series for the fourth time in eight years and won in the COVID, 60-game 2020 campaign. They last won in a 162-game season in 1988.

So there are a lot of legacies for players, executives and franchises on the line in a best-of-seven that will stretch from Chavez Ravine to The Bronx in two of the most famous stadiums in the world. Let’s hope the production lives up to the preview. There are some mirror-image qualities to these teams. Let’s take a deeper scouting dive:

The stars

We will make an easy assumption that Judge and Ohtani will be their league MVPs. The last time a World Series had both was 2012, with Detroit’s Miguel Cabrera and San Francisco’s Buster Posey. The last time each league’s homer champ was in the World Series was 1956 (Dodgers’ Duke Snider/Yankees Mickey Mantle). But there has never been a World Series with two 50-homer hitters.

A lot in this series will come down to how often the lineups turn over and, thus, how often Ohtani/Betts/Freeman bat for the Dodgers and Soto/Judge/Stanton for the Yankees. Stanton, coming off the ALCS MVP, is coming home to Southern California and Dodger Stadium, where he has 10 homers and 26 RBIs in 25 games and won the 2022 All-Star Game MVP.

The literal leading men for both teams have excelled this postseason.

The Dodgers have played 11 postseason games and scored in the first two innings in 10 with a total of 18 runs. The top two in the lineup, Ohtani and Betts, have slugged a combined .793 in those frames (via MLB Network research).

The Yankee top two, Gleyber Torres and Soto, have reached in 15 of 18 first-inning plate appearances, but the Yankees have just four runs — a two-run homer by Soto, an RBI single by Soto and a dropped Judge pop-up by Guardians shortstop Brayan Rocchio. The other Yankees are a combined 0-for-23 in the first inning. Judge is 0-for-8.

It underscores a huge difference between the biggest stars this postseason.

Ohtani is 6-for-9 with runners in scoring position this postseason and the Dodgers were 33-for-106 (.311) in such situations with 14 extra-base hits, including eight homers. The Yankees are 13-for-72 with four extra-base hits and three homers, all by Soto and Stanton, who were a combined 7-for-12 with runners in scoring position. Judge was 0-for-7 and is 1-for-his-last-24 in the postseason dating to 2019 with runners in scoring position.

So Judge must rise and the Yankees have to unplug Ohtani. A pitching coach offered this theory how: “If you have a slow sweeper or a slow curveball or really anything slow because you have to go slow-fast with [Ohtani]. If you are just hard cutter, hard sinker, hard slider and stay in the 85-95 [mph] window, good luck, it just doesn’t work. But if you can throw something in the 70s with break, even if it is a ball, that messes up his timing and maybe you get some balls on the ground.”

Co-stars

Ohtani is not the only Dodger thriving with runners in scoring position. Judge is not the only Yankee struggling.

Ohtani, Betts, NLCS MVP Tommy Edman and Kiké Hernandez were a combined 19-for-40 with runners in scoring position through two playoff rounds while Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Austin Wells (who both got cleanup reps) were a combined 1-for-19.

During the regular season, the Dodgers had seven players (tied for the MLB high) with at least 250 plate appearances and a 110 OPS-plus or better — Ohtani, Betts, Freeman, Max Muncy, Smith, Teoscar Hernandez and Miguel Rojas. The Yankees had three — Judge, Soto and Stanton. In the ALCS, Judge, Soto and Stanton teamed for nine homers, 19 RBIs and a 1.222 OPS while every other Yankee had one homer, six RBIs and a .656 OPS.

“I think the Dodgers are tougher to play against because it’s just such a grind facing their offense,” Executive 1 said. “It’s really, really hard to keep that offense down over the course of that long of a series. And I don’t think the Yankees, while they have a really [expletive] good offense, but not as good as that.”

One way the Dodgers made themselves better is by getting deeper from the right-hand side. Obviously, teams want to have as many lefties as possible to go after Ohtani, Freeman and Muncy. Only Judge at 1.159 had a better OPS against righties in the regular season than Ohtani’s 1.036. It was .867 vs. lefties. Freeman and Muncy were mid-.800 OPS vs. righties and mid-.700 OPS vs. lefties, and 3-for-20 combined through two playoff rounds.

It is why, for example, the Mets took Adam Ottavino off their NLCS roster for Danny Young. The Yankees are putting Nestor Cortes on the World Series roster to join lefties Tim Hill and Tim Mayza in the pen.

But the Dodgers improved against lefties. The Yankees wanted Kiké Hernandez to be their versatile righty-hitting piece, but he preferred to return to the Dodgers and the Yanks traded for Jon Berti. Hernandez is Robert Horry in the playoffs — a complementary player who becomes a star: 15 homers and an .889 OPS in 239 plate appearances. Edman was another player the Yankees coveted, but the Dodgers worked themselves into a three-way deal to land him from the Cardinals at the trade deadline.

Edman is 9-for-14 against lefties this postseason with three doubles and a homer. It makes the Game 2 start by Carlos Rodon trickier. Because beyond Edman’s surge, Kiké Hernandez is 3-for-6 lifetime against Rodon with all three hits being homers and Chris Taylor is 5-for-9 off Rodon with two doubles and a homer. But if form holds, there is also this: Betts is just 1-for-19 lifetime against Rodon and, so far, 3-for-16 in the postseason against lefties.

Among Yankees costars, Torres and the Anthonys — Rizzo and Volpe — are a combined 26-for-80 (.325) with 17 walks against 14 strikeouts. But to get batting average and on-base results, they have used the whole field at the sacrifice of power — five extra-base hits, including just one homer. Volpe has been the hitter in October he should always be with patience and gap-to-gap results. He has reached base safely in all nine postseason games, has a better on-base percentage (.459) than Soto (.439) these playoffs and has seen 4.70 pitches per plate appearance, which is the eighth most since tracking began in 1988 with a minimum of 35 plate appearances (via MLB Network research).

The walks

There is a lot of late-1990s Yankees in the ability of both lineups to wear down pitching and get into bullpens quickly. The Yanks are walking in 13.9 percent of their plate appearances this postseason, the Dodgers 12.6, every other team 8.6. The Dodgers drew a postseason series record 42 walks (11 by Muncy) against the Mets — 17 scored.

“Now you’re facing the varsity,” Scout 1 said. “Watching the Guardians and the Royals, they expand the zone from top to bottom. You’re not going to get that here. And from Mookie Betts to Will Smith to Max Muncy, these guys don’t strike out. They don’t chase and I think that is the adjustment that the Yankee pitching staff will probably have to make the most to win in the zone. Because Tommy Kahnle throwing 18 straight changeups out of the zone, that’s not working here.”

The scout added: “You saw what happened with Jose Quintana who wins by getting you to chase out of the zone. That doesn’t work against the Dodgers.” Quintana allowed nine of 19 Dodgers to reach and they scored five runs in 3 ¹/₃ innings in NLCS Game 4.

Executive 2: “For the most part, they do not chase offensively. They control the strike zone really well. You are not going to beat them giving free passes, especially at the bottom of the lineup. That turns their lineup over and that is a recipe for disaster.”

6 Tommy Edman hits a two-run double against the Mets in NLCS Game 6. AP

Both lineups have the same philosophy. They were 1-2 in the majors in lowest chase rate and highest walk totals. They will take walks to try to do multi-run damage with one swing, keep churning through the lineup to get back to the star-studded top and eventually force you into the zone (often in favorable counts) to go for the damage.

“You can’t nibble against them,” Executive 2 said. “You have to try to win in the strike zone. I think Gerrit Cole has to set the example from the beginning and be on the attack. You have to make them beat you hitting the ball. If you walk them and get into bad counts, forget it.”

The pitching coach: “You can’t just throw it over the plate, you have to throw it over the plate with stuff. And what I think is fascinating is the Dodgers are a terrific sinkerball hitting team and the Yankees throw a lot of sinkers. So do they change for this series and throw more breaking balls or stick with a strength?”

In this series, the Yanks may have an advantage of having four starters while the Dodgers have only three, and with real questions as to how much length those starters can provide while already knowing they will throw at least one bullpen game. Over the last three years, in 476 plate appearances when a hitter sees a reliever for at least the third time in a series, the slash line is .274/.340/.488 with 21 homers, including Soto’s 10th-inning shot off Hunter Gaddis to enable the Yanks to win the pennant Saturday in Game 5 in Cleveland. So even if the surging closer Blake Treinen with his stellar sweeper/sinker combo gets into the game often and superb lefty reliever Alex Vesia makes it back from an intercostal injury, the Yanks will probably feel if they see it all enough, there will be some demystification.

So, as well as both bullpens have done, getting them into the game early and often will matter.

“If the Dodgers lineup faced the Dodgers bullpen, those bullpen games would not work,” Scout 1 said. “They would grind the hell out of that pen. The Yankees have to do that.”

Scout 2: “Get the [Dodger] relievers into the game early when the starters are starting, so when they go to the bullpen game, those guys are fried.”

The pitching coach: “If a Yankee starter goes five innings every time out, they will win this series. But that’s not easy because that lineup wears you out and then it gets a lead and when you fall behind against them, you start chasing it by getting your bullpen into the game to try to slow it down.”

The style

Both teams rely on homers and the short porch at Yankee Stadium, but two members of our panel noted how the ball flies from gap-to-gap at Dodger Stadium in late-afternoon starts (which will be all games in Los Angeles) before the marine layer sets in at night.

So if the long balls are equal, the Dodgers have an edge with a cleaner style. The Yankees were by far the worst baserunning team in the majors this year and had three players picked off versus Cleveland, plus Torres thrown out at the plate. But Cleveland was inferior, the Yankees hit homers as camouflage and Executive 2 said, “They got away with it against the Guardians. I don’t think they get away with it [against the Dodgers].”

The Dodgers were the fourth-best baserunning team by FanGraphs’ metric. They are 11-for-12 stealing bases this postseason. The Dodgers were judicious running against the Mets. Perhaps because they were doing so much damage at the plate, they wondered why risk anything on the bases? But opponents in the regular and postseason are a combined 38-for-44 against Cole/Rodon when trying to steal.

After 59 regular-season steals and just four nabbed, Ohtani has tried just one steal this postseason, and was caught. But you have to watch him, including that he stole third nine times.

“You can’t get lazy against their running game or else a Teoscar Hernandez or Will Smith will sneak a steal in,” Executive 2 said.

There was consensus that the Dodgers are a buttoned-up team and will have scouted the Yankees well, moving Scout 2 to say, “If Jazz is not in the right place on a cutoff or Gleyber gets careless in the field or they miss cutoff men, the Dodgers will keep taking an extra 90 feet.”

Conversely, when the Dodgers are in the field, Executive 2 said: “I don’t think any team positions its fielders better than the Dodgers, especially in the outfield.” Los Angeles was second in the majors in defensive efficiency — basically the percentage of balls hit turned into outs.

The outfield trio of Betts, Andy Pages and Teoscar Hernandez all have strong arms, but Hernandez’s lateral quickness is not great and if he is moving, Scout 1 said, “Balls tend to get by him and to the wall or you can run on him if he is moving side to side.”",2395,"plate, scouting, recipe, series, judge, world, game, homers, postseason, strength, soto, yankees, dodgers, report, disaster"
37,air macbook m2 upgrade deals apple might early join said,"Apple might be updating several Macs with M4 chips as early as next week, but it’s looking like the MacBook Air lineup might not join the party until early 2025. That said, if you’re on an older MacBook and can’t wait to upgrade, there have been few better times than now. The base 13-inch M2 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage has fallen to an all-time low of $699.9 ($200 off) at Amazon, while the step-up 512GB model is down to $949.99 ($249 off) thanks to an on-page coupon. You can even grab the M3 MacBook Air 13 at Amazon starting at $899 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low.

Although the M1 Air was technically discontinued earlier this year, we still considered its $699 price a great value for routine computing. That being said, you should certainly skip that for the M2 upgrade if that’s all you can afford. The M2 Air offers a thinner design and a notched display that’s a touch brighter at 500 nits. It also features an improved 1080p webcam, a better keyboard, and a resurrected MagSafe port for charging, freeing up the second of its two USB-C / Thunderbolt ports. It’s even slated to receive a number of AI-powered features via Apple Intelligence, which will arrive later in October via a software update.

The M3 MacBook Air from earlier this year isn’t a massive upgrade over the M2. It has a slightly faster processor with Wi-Fi 6E radios, faster SSD transfers, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and AV1 video decoding. If those changes don’t benefit your experience in any meaningful way, you’ll likely get by just fine with the M2 model.

38,hearing users new airpods pro firmware apple ios feature 2,"Apple has just released new firmware for AirPods Pro 2 ahead of iOS 18.1’s launch next week. This firmware update brings support for the powerful new health features: Hearing Test, Hearing Aid, and Hearing Protection.

Firmware arrives ahead of iOS 18.1’s launch next week

AirPods Pro 2’s newest firmware carries build number 7B19. It is rolling out to all users now.

Once installed, AirPods Pro 2 users will also need to update to iOS 18.1 before they can use the new hearing health features.

Here are Apple’s release notes for the new additions:

Hearing Test feature provides scientifically-validated hearing test results from the comfort of home (intended for users 18 years or older)

39,apple intelligence ai competitors privacy features best chatgpt ios access,"The first Apple Intelligence features are launching next week with iOS 18.1, and beta testers have even now gained access to wave two in iOS 18.2. I’ve been using many of these AI features on my iPhone, iPad, and Mac since July. Here are the three advantages Apple Intelligence has over its AI competitors.

#1: Tapping into existing apps and features

Apple is a product company. Its AI competitors have made attempts at being product companies, with wildly varying success.

I’m a big fan of the Apple Intelligence motto, ‘AI for the rest of us,’ because I think it’s true.

Apple Intelligence is baked into the existing apps, features, and devices that millions upon millions of people use every day.

That’s a tough advantage to match.

Here’s a sampling of Apple Intelligence features that demonstrate what I mean:

everyone receives notifications, and summaries make them better

we all love emoji, and Genmoji offer a fun twist on the feature

millions rely on Siri, and it’s finally getting better

email inboxes can be messy, so priority mail is clutch

Photos is a key app, and it gets three AI upgrades

Most of Apple’s competitors are trying to create new AI experiences that come with a learning curve of sorts, or a habit curve at least.

Apple Intelligence is built into the existing habits and tools we all rely on. That makes it unique.

#2: Integrating the best of the AI competition

Here’s a key advantage Apple Intelligence has over its competitors: it integrates some of the best of those competitors, and the exchange isn’t mutual.

In iOS 18.2, ChatGPT is baked into Siri and Apple’s own writing tools.

Essentially, one of Apple Intelligence’s premier competitors is giving its full intelligence capabilities to Apple.

You can send your Siri requests directly to ChatGPT, bypassing permission prompts altogether, giving you the best of both company’s AI tools in one package.

Visual intelligence similarly integrates not only ChatGPT, but also Google image search. And there’s a solid chance Google Gemini will come fully baked into Apple Intelligence at some point in the future.

Apple, meanwhile, isn’t giving its Apple Intelligence tech to these other companies.

Obviously there are mutual benefits for each company. But from a user-facing standpoint, only Apple Intelligence offers Apple’s AI plus that of its competitors.

#3: Protecting user privacy

I’m not claiming that other AI companies are bad actors out to trample all over users’ privacy. But Apple Intelligence has privacy tenets that its competitors just don’t.

Apple’s go-to for AI tasks is on-device processing. This means the data used for AI notification summaries, photo object removal, and more will stay on your device. Only someone who can physically access your device will have access to that data.

Then there’s Private Cloud Compute. Apple has a highly detailed research paper outlining everything PCC can do. But essentially, Apple has built an innovative way for AI tasks to run in the cloud with, in theory, just as much privacy protection as local tasks provide.

You can read more about Apple Intelligence and privacy here, and the details of how privacy works with the ChatGPT integration here.

Apple Intelligence advantages: Wrap-up

Much has been said about Apple being ‘behind’ when it comes to AI. Whether that’s true or not, Apple clearly has several key advantages with Apple Intelligence that could help it best the competition before long. We’re just on the cusp of Apple Intelligence’s launch, but the future looks bright.

How do you see Apple Intelligence’s position relative to competitors? Let us know in the comments.

40,claude anthropic analysis data code tool results could models write,"Anthropic’s Claude chatbot can now write and run JavaScript code.

Today, Anthropic launched a new analysis tool that helps Claude respond with what the company describes as “mathematically precise and reproducible answers.” With the tool enabled — it’s currently in preview — Claude can perform calculations and analyze data from files like spreadsheets and PDFs, rendering the results as interactive visualizations.

“Think of the analysis tool as a built-in code sandbox, where Claude can do complex math, analyze data, and iterate on different ideas before sharing an answer,” Anthropic wrote in a blog post. “Instead of relying on abstract analysis alone, it can systematically process your data — cleaning, exploring, and analyzing it step-by-step until it reaches the correct result.”

Anthropic gives a few examples of where this might be useful. For instance, a product manager could upload sales data and ask Claude for country-specific performance analysis, while an engineer could give Claude monthly financial data and have it create a dashboard highlighting key trends.

Claude could attempt these tasks before. But, because it lacked a mechanism to mathematically verify the results, the answers weren’t always incredibly accurate.

Google offers a comparable feature for its Gemini models called Code Execution, which lets the models generate and run Python code to learn iteratively from the results. OpenAI’s flagship models similarly can write and execute code via a capability that the company calls Advanced Data Analysis.

42,charging satechi trio pad version wireless new also devices qi2,"Satechi has announced an updated version of its Trio Wireless Charging Pad that increases the power delivery to smartphones to 15W through an upgraded Qi2 charger. The new Satechi Qi2 Trio Wireless Charging Pad now also supports 5W fast charging for the Apple Watch, including the Series 7, 8, and 9 and both versions of the Ultra.

Made from a mix of aluminum, vegan leather, and soft silicone to prevent devices from getting scratched, the charging pad is available starting today through Satechi’s website for $129.99. That’s $10 more expensive than the original version, but in addition to potentially faster charge times, Satechi has also included some design improvements on the new Trio.

Devices connected to the pad can lay flat while they charge. Image: Satechi

The older Trio charging pad let you angle its Apple Watch charger upward to use the wearable’s nightstand mode, but it positioned all other devices at a slight fixed angle that left smartphones laying basically flat. With the new version of the Trio, the upgraded Qi2 charging puck is attached to an articulated arm that can now elevate a charging smartphone, allowing features like the iPhone’s StandBy mode to be used when it’s positioned horizontally.

Although the pad seems best suited for a desk or bedside table, Satechi says it’s also useful for traveling, requiring just a single USB-C cable and its included 45W power adapter. However, the new version of the Trio is a bit thicker than the previous one and a few grams heavier. If you’re looking for a convenient way to charge three devices at once on the road, Anker’s 3-in-1 MagGo Wireless Charging Station is smaller, lighter, and cheaper, while also supporting 15W wireless charging speeds.",304,"satechi, qi2, watch, satechis, faster, version, 3in1, trio, charge, devices, pad, charging, wireless"
43,oneplus camera 13 new array packed along looks company lens,"The OnePlus 13 is set to come with a slightly upgraded camera array packed in a very familiar body. OnePlus noted this change along with several camera samples to show off the new sensors.

In a large respect, the OnePlus 13 looks a lot like the OnePlus 12 that came before it. The shape, general size, and camera array all look similar. That’s not a bad thing, as the OnePlus 12 was easily one of the best phones the company has released. That includes the cameras packed within.

Still, OnePlus seemingly felt like the lineup needed to be upgraded in some respect. The company posted specs for the new OnePlus 13 cameras on Weibo, along with some stunning sample imagery (via GSMArena). The main camera will stay a wide lens with a Sony LYT-808 sensor – same sensor used on the OnePlus 12.

The 50MP periscope telephoto lens, however, has been adjusted to fit in a more compact space. OnePlus calls the new development a “multi-prism” design capable of 3x optical zoom. The periscope multi-prism lens carries an f/2.6 aperture and OIS, which is necessary for tight shots.

The samples posted to go along with the teaser showcase a camera that looks fully capable of capturing stunning photos. It’s hard to tell how much correction these images have undergone. Each is also tagged with Hasselblad branding, per the company’s collaborative nature with OnePlus.

This all comes packed into a phone that carries a Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, up to 24GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. OnePlus looks to be planning to announce the OnePlus 13 and it’s new camera array on October 31.
