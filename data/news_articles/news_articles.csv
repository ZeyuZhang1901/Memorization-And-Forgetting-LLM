Brian Niccols, CEO of Starbucks, speaking with CNBC on Oct. 31st, 2024. CNBC

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol shared more details about the company's turnaround strategy during the company's quarterly conference call on Wednesday. For three straight quarters, Starbucks has reported declining sales. But the coffee chain is hoping that some easy tweaks to its U.S. business will pay off and help reverse the trend as it plots a more ambitious and comprehensive game plan. Many of the coming changes are meant to help Starbucks achieve a smaller goal: delivering a customized drink to the customer in under four minutes. About half of current transactions are within that threshold, according to Niccol.

As Starbucks focuses on the turnaround, the company is also planning fewer new locations and renovations in fiscal 2025 to free up capital, CFO Rachel Ruggeri told investors on the call. Shares of Starbucks were flat in trading Thursday after the company reported that its revenue fell for the third straight quarter. Here's how Niccol plans to help Starbucks' sales rebound:

Ending the disorder of mobile order and pay

Starbucks customers have become used to walking into a cafe and seeing a counter crowded with mobile orders. Niccol wants to change that. ""When it works well, it's great, but sometimes it can be a challenge for both customers and partners,"" he told investors on the company's conference call. Mobile orders account for more than 30% of Starbucks' U.S. transactions.

Niccol said Starbucks is working to improve the accuracy of the app's timing, so customers know when their drinks are ready. Plus, he wants to better separate mobile order pickups from in-person ordering inside restaurants and curtail how much customers can customize their drinks. ""Right now, I think there's some customization specifically in the mobile order app execution that's just really wide and unnecessary,"" Niccol told CNBC. ""So I just think that we need to put better guardrails in place so that we get you access to customization that's correct for the drink you're ordering, and then also it allows our baristas to be more consistent with what they execute.""

Cutting back an 'overly complex' menu

The Starbucks menu will be getting a makeover. Niccol said the coffee chain needs to focus on ""fewer, better"" offerings. Slimming down the menu will make it easier for baristas to make every drink consistently. It should also improve speed of service since they'll have fewer drink recipes to remember. ""There's always a long tail on the menu, and those items, frankly, we don't execute all that great,"" Niccol said, adding that baristas often take longer to make drinks that are unfamiliar. Niccol said Starbucks would also be taking a look at the items that it wouldn't have put on the menu if the four-minute standard was already in place. While the changes may disappoint some customers, Niccol said he thinks that they'll appreciate faster, more consistent service in the long run.

Making cafes more personal

As part of Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, he wants the company's locations to feel like ""third places"" for customers to work and socialize in outside of their homes and offices. The coffee chain's positioning as a ""third place"" helped it grow into a global behemoth, but somewhere along the way, it lost that reputation. Niccol said he wants to reintroduce more personal touches, like serving coffee in ceramic mugs to customers who choose to linger in cafes. Sharpies will also be making their triumphant return, after being supplanted by printed labels. Starbucks is also reviewing its store designs, with a focus on bringing back more comfortable seating and amenities.

""The reality is the majority of what we have are these cafes that I think don't have the right seats, potentially have the right texture, don't have the right layers, don't have the right warmth. We need to bring that back,"" Niccol said. In recent years, the company has rolled out more pickup-only locations, with little to no seating, particularly in urban areas. Niccol said even those cafes could be more welcoming to customers. ""I think there are design elements that can still bring forward this idea of a community coffeehouse, even in some of the executions that we've made that just don't lend itself to putting the full, traditional coffeehouse experience,"" he told CNBC.

Bringing back the condiment bars

In the early days of the Covid pandemic, Starbucks banished its condiment bars behind the counter. Since then, when customers want to add milk or sugar to their drinks — even a simple drip coffee — they have to ask baristas directly. But that will change soon. Niccol said the condiment bars will reappear, freeing up more time for baristas and easing some customer headaches.

Better staffing in cafes

Starbucks has already been increasing the average number of hours that it schedules baristas. More shifts — and more consistent scheduling — have lowered the company's turnover and helped overall retention. But Niccol also wants to make sure that cafes are properly staffed, from the busy morning rush to ""shoulder hours,"" leading up to and away from peak times.

A new approach to marketing

Since his first week on the job in early September, Niccol has said that he wants to revamp the company's marketing. On Wednesday's call, he said he wants its marketing to target a broader audience than Starbucks Rewards members and to showcase the quality of Starbucks coffee. Customers can also expect to see fewer deals as part of the marketing shift. Niccol said discount-driven offers are ""ineffective"" and can overburden baristas. Niccol comes from a marketing background and started his career at Procter & Gamble . He then moved to Yum Brands and worked in various marketing positions before ascending to lead Taco Bell. That marketing expertise was useful when he joined Chipotle and will likely also prove valuable at Starbucks. He's already tapped a former Chipotle alum, Tressie Lieberman, as the new chief global brand officer of Starbucks.

Dairy alternatives finally won't cost extra

After years of pleading from customers, Starbucks will finally drop the extra charge for its milk substitutes, starting Nov. 7. The change means some customers could save more than 10% on the cost of the drinks, according to the company.

2,peloton stern peter ford ceo company role said executive next,"Peloton on Thursday said it has appointed Peter Stern, a Ford executive and the co-founder of Apple Fitness+ to be its next CEO and president.

Stern, the president of Ford Integrated Services, primarily oversees the automotive company's subscription services, such as BlueCruise, Pro Intelligence, connectivity and security. He also led the company's digital product team.

Stern is slated to step down from his role at Ford and take the helm of Peloton on Jan. 1. Interim co-CEO Karen Boone will stay in the role through the end of the calendar year, while her counterpart, Chris Bruzzo will step down from the co-CEO role on Friday. Both Boone and Bruzzo will stay on Peloton's board.

Stern is the third CEO to lead Peloton in its history. The news came alongside Peloton's fiscal first-quarter earnings report. Shares of the company closed about 28% higher.

""Peter is a seasoned strategist with a track record of driving sustainable growth through innovation, and we have every confidence in his ability to lead Peloton during this important time. He brings meaningful expertise in scaling differentiated technology-oriented platforms and has a deep understanding of the health and wellness sector – making him uniquely suited to serve as Peloton's next CEO,"" Jay Hoag, the chairperson of Peloton's board, said in a news release.

""What's more, Peter embodies Peloton's core values, including operating with a bias for action, empowering teams of smart creatives and working together.""

The announcement comes about six months after Peloton announced that former Spotify and Netflix executive Barry McCarthy would be stepping down after about two years on the job.

3,kalshi election betting mansour people 8 lopes bet new presidential,"Two 20-something New Yorkers have added an entirely new dimension to the 2024 presidential election: legal betting.

The new platform Kalshi offers the first legal election betting in the US in over a century. Its founders believe it will give voters more transparency and make them feel more involved in the process.

“It’s actually the best mechanism to get more truth about who’s actually going to win,” said Tarek Mansour, 28, who founded Kalshi with Luana Lopes Lara, also 28. “We’re letting the market speak instead of pundits, pollsters, people, political figures, people with biases or conflicts of interest, people that had incentives or not.”

8 Kalshi co-founder Tarek Mansour decided to launch a betting platform after seeing the demand for hedges during the 2016 election. EMMY PARK

Over the last few weeks, the innovative company has exploded in popularity. Users have put down more than $100 million on Kalshi’s election bet, and the site has been name-checked by JD Vance, Elon Musk and comedian Theo Von.

“Kalshi is a place where I look,” Vonn recently said in a podcast. “It’s a good tracker, it’s actually people putting their money down.”

The platform is run like a futures exchange where a marketplace facilitates trades about what could happen. Conventional exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange process bets about oil or cattle prices. Kalshi does the same thing — just for current events.

8 Theo Von and vice presidential candidate JD Vance (pictured) recently discussed Kalshi on a podcast episode. @Kalshi/X

Someone who believes in the likelihood of an event — like Trump winning — will place a bet, and Kalshi matches them with someone willing to take the other side of the bet.

The site is also currently taking bets on everything from how many rocket launches SpaceX will make this year to what score “Gladiator 2” will receive on Rotten Tomatoes.

Part of the reason for the initial excitement — particularly from Republicans — is that the betting markets suggest Trump has a much greater chance of winning than the polls. As of this writing, a bet for Trump will cost you 63 cents with the potential for a one-dollar return while a bet that Harris will win costs just 37 cents.

8 Founders Luana Lopes Lara (pictured) and Tarek Mansour spent more than three years getting their election prediction betting approved. EMMY PARK

But it’s not just about betting; it’s about giving people a new way of being involved in the democratic process.

“People have had this sort of feeling, like ‘I don’t have control of who wins and I’m just going to take the impact and the consequence no matter what it is,’” Mansour said. “People can now participate, engage a bit more meaning through the election.”

While Kalshi has offered betting on inflation and jobs numbers since 2021, the exchange only got the green light to launch an election betting service in October after a lengthy and hard-fought legal war.

8 Elon Musk has posted about Kalshi — and referenced it is a way he is tracking the election. @elonmusk/X

Mansour first began thinking about the importance of a betting market for elections while working on the trading desk at Goldman Sachs in 2016.

When Trump won that year, his team was inundated with frantic calls to make trades and buy hedges in response to the upset.

“People want a financial stake in the election,” he explained. “Trading activity… actually stems from an opinion about a future event — why are we [just] using stocks and bonds and options to do that?

8 More than 100 million dollars has flooded into Kalshi’s presidential election betting platform in a matter of weeks. EMMY PARK

“This is a more direct, more precise way… than traditional financial instruments,” he added. “What you’re buying is the event — Trump will win, Kamala will win, Brexit will happen, Brexit won’t happen — that was the genesis of the idea.”

While some people are using the market to amuse themselves or gauge public sentiment about a candidate, Mansour initially envisioned it as a way for individuals or institutions to hedge risk before an event.

For instance, someone who has a lot of exposure to fossil fuel could put money on a Harris victory — as a way to balance their portfolio in the event Harris wins and gives subsidies to green companies.

Mansour, who was raised in Lebanon and Lopes Laura — a classmate of his from MIT who was working at Bridgewater and hails from Brazil — launched the company in 2018 with investment from heavyweights including Sequoia Capital, Henry Kravis, and Charles Schwab.

Their headquarters are in Soho, and they say they couldn’t imagine being based anywhere but the Big Apple.

“New York is the financial capital of the world,” said Mansour. “We felt it was the right place to build what we believe will be the next evolution of financial markets.”

But, they didn’t anticipate the regulatory hurdles they would face. They first applied for approval to take presidential election bets in 2021, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission turned them down.

While the CFTC let them offer bets about other events — like when inflation would decrease or whether TikTok would get banned — the presidential election was deemed too sensitive by regulators.

8 Nearly 45 employees — and one dog — work from the company’s Soho headquarters. EMMY PARK

They believe that a handful of individuals could bid up the price making it look like one candidate is more likely to win — potentially leading more people to vote or feel pressure to support a candidate.

After realizing the CFTC was unlikely to ever give them the green light, Mansour and Lopes Laura took the matter to court. This past September, after a three-year battle, a judge finally ruled in their favor.

Neither of them imagined how difficult it would be to secure approval, but Lopes Laura believes that their ignorance might have given them an advantage.

They were so naive, they dared to try something other companies thought was impossible.

And, they say that by going through the legal quagmire to earn regulatory approval, they established themselves as a safe and trusted product.

Other election betting markets, such as Polymarket and PredictIt have also been generating buzz. But, Polymarket is not open to US citizens, and PredictIt has only been granted the ability to operate temporarily.

“A lot of startups kind of choose the easy path. But we really think long term,” Lopes Laura said. “If in ten, 20 years, prediction markets have a chance of being that big, it’s because we started the right way.”",1158,"lopes, paying, kalshis, win, election, bet, mansour, kalshi, presidential, betting, daring, platform, trump, way",2024-10-31
4,jobs strike report october job hurricanes expected cut week workers,"The Labor Department is scheduled to release its jobs report for October on Friday, which will be the last major economic data release ahead of Election Day and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.

American voters and Fed policymakers will have the opportunity to analyze the state of play in the labor market and factor that into their respective decisions next week. Voters will determine whether control of government will be divided between, or unified under Democrats or Republicans — while central bank policymakers will determine whether to lower interest rates again and by how much.

The U.S. economy is projected to have added 115,000 jobs in October, according to an LSEG poll of economists. That would be a much slower pace of job growth than in September, when 254,000 jobs were added, well above the LSEG forecast of 140,000 jobs.

October's jobs report will be influenced in part by several factors that could show slower job growth than anticipated — including the recent hurricanes that struck the southeastern U.S. as well as labor disputes.

US ECONOMY GREW 2.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER, SLOWER THAN EXPECTED

Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, explained that her firm expects the ongoing Boeing strike, plus a smaller, recently resolved strike and auto sector layoffs, will result in a net loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector for October — though those attributed to the strike may return in future reports.

""We expect the strike affecting 33,000 workers at Boeing and a strike of 5,000 workers at Textron, an aerospace parts maker in Kansas, to drive a decline in manufacturing jobs of 50,000,"" she said in a report. Vanden Houten added that while the Textron strike ended a week ago, it was in effect during the Bureau of Labor Statistics' reference period for the October jobs report.

JOB OPENINGS TUMBLE MORE THAN EXPECTED TO THE LOWEST SINCE JANUARY 2021

She also noted that layoffs at Stellantis impacted about 2,000 workers, and that the ongoing Boeing strike has caused issues for the aerospace giant's suppliers, causing them to furlough workers in other sectors. An additional strike by 3,400 hotel workers will detract from job creation in the leisure and hospitality industry.

Vanden Houten added that Hurricanes Helene and Milton are expected to subtract about 70,000 from net job growth across industries, but particularly in leisure and hospitality, business and professional services, and construction.

She noted that there is ""considerable uncertainty in the impact of the hurricanes on employment,"" but that the firm's analysis considered both the impact of hurricanes on comparable regions and the size of employment in affected industries in the areas hardest hit by the hurricanes, such as Asheville, North Carolina.

MACHINISTS UNION REJECTS BOEING CONTRACT OFFER, EXTENDING STRIKE

Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, offered a similar analysis of those impacts on the October jobs report and explained that it could result in a mixed outlook for the economy after the ADP jobs report was stronger than expected and U.S. third-quarter GDP was cooler than expected in Wednesday's data releases.

""Hurricanes and strikes are expected to result in a softer jobs report this Friday, and so far this week, the data has been mixed — job openings fell and layoffs increased, while ADP private payrolls were the strongest in a year,"" Zentner said. ""GDP may have missed estimates slightly, but it still suggests the economy is still on solid ground. And with inflation continuing to trend lower, it isn't overheating. Bottom line, the data supports the Fed's rate-cutting plan .""

The market currently expects that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week after a larger than usual 50 basis point cut in September, which was the first rate cut in four years. As of Wednesday, traders have priced in a 94.6% probability of a 25 basis point cut, with just a 5.4% chance the Fed holds rates steady, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Those expectations have undergone a notable shift over the past month — on Sept. 30, traders saw just a 65.3% probability of a 25 basis-point cut and a 34.7% chance of a second 50 basis-point cut, per CME FedWatch.",713,"rate, feds, decision, job, expected, jobs, days, day, week, hurricanes, cut, workers, election, report, strike, labor, arrive",Unknown
5,results fell reported microsoft meta shares investors said points three,"By Abigail Summerville

(Reuters) -All three U.S. stock indexes closed lower on Thursday after Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.

Shares of Facebook-owner Meta Platforms slipped 4.1% and Microsoft fell 6%, despite both companies beating earnings estimates in results reported after the bell on Wednesday.

Among other so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology companies, Amazon.com and Apple reported quarterly results after the market close. Amazon beat revenue estimates, boosted by strong growth in its cloud services unit. Apple also beat revenue and profit expectations as iPhone sales grew.

Shares of Alphabet, which reported on Tuesday, fell 1.9%.

""You had three of the Magnificent Seven all say they basically have open-ended budgets for AI spend and investors don't like to hear that,"" said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.

""The intermediate and longer-term implications of this buildout are really important for U.S. long-term growth and long-term productivity. ... In the short run, investors are asking where's the profit from it?""

Microsoft and Meta both said capital expenses were growing due to AI investments, which could reduce profitability.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 378.08 points, or 0.90%, to 41,763.46. The S&P 500 lost 108.22 points, or 1.86%, at 5,705.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 512.78 points, or 2.76%, to 18,095.15.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric, rose 0.2% in September, in line with economists' expectations. However, the core figure was 2.7% year-over-year, slightly above the 2.6% forecast, while consumer spending increased a little more than expected.

After the data, traders stuck to bets for a 25-basis-point rate reduction in the Fed's Nov. 6-7 meeting.

""We do expect them to cut by a quarter next week because there is nothing in the data this week that should throw them off of that,"" Schleif said.

Information technology led declines among sectors, but upbeat results from ConocoPhillips and Entergy lifted energy and utilities.

An index of chip stocks fell 4%, led by a 17.4% plunge in Monolithic Power Systems shares after the maker of power control products and semiconductors used in vehicles reported its results. Nvidia also dropped 4.7%.

The VIX, Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" ticked up as investors braced for more volatility in the next few weeks from corporate results and the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election followed by the Fed's policy-setting meeting.

6,siemens company said altair market deal engineering software billion acquisition,"By John Revill

(Reuters) -Siemens is to buy U.S. engineering software firm Altair Engineering for $10.6 billion, strengthening its position in the growing market for industrial software.

The deal, Siemens's second biggest acquisition, is part of the German engineering group's increased focus on a sector being revolutionised by data analysis and artificial intelligence.

Michigan-based Altair is active in the product lifecycle management (PLM) industry - systems that manage product life-cycles from conception to development, manufacture, service and disposal.

The market for PLM simulation software is currently $10 billion per year and will grow by 10% over the next five years, Siemens said.

Following the deal, the Munich-based company will increase its market share from 9% to 15%, lifting it from number 4 to number 2 behind Ansys, which has 23%.

Other rivals include privately-held MathWorks with 14%, and Dassault Systemes with 10% of the market.

Siemens CEO Roland Busch said combining Siemens' online digital platform Xcelerator with Altair ""will create the world's most complete AI-powered design and simulation portfolio"".

The transaction is anticipated to add to Siemens' earnings per share in about two years from the deal's closing, expected in the second half of 2025.

It will also add about $500 million in annual revenue to Siemens in the mid-term and more than $1 billion per year in the long term, Siemens said.

Analysts were cheered by the acquisition, but there were some concerns about the price, an 18.7% premium to Altair's close on Oct. 21, a day before Reuters first reported the company was exploring a sale.

Analysts at Alpha Wertpapierhandel said the deal, while not cheap, would strengthen Siemens' struggling digital industries division.

Jefferies analyst Simon Toennessen said the acquisition gave Siemens more expertise around artificial intelligence and high performance computers.

It would also make the group a more credible rival to chip-design company Synopsys, which agreed to buy Ansys earlier this year, as well as Cadence Design Systems.

Siemens also announced on Thursday it was selling its airport baggage and cargo handling business to Vanderlande, owned by Toyota Industries Corporation, for 300 million euros.

The company was the last portfolio company held by Siemens - a batch of company laggards earmarked for turnaround and sale because they did not fit the company's focus on transport, factory automation and smart buildings.

7,bank japan boj rate decision china previous manufacturing since lower,"Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), speaks during a news conference at the central bank's headquarters in Tokyo, Japan Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images

Asia-Pacific markets slipped Thursday as investors look to the Bank of Japan's rate decision, as well as key business activity figures from China. The BOJ held its benchmark policy rate at 0.25%, unchanged from the previous meeting. The bank released a two-line statement simply stating the decision, with no clues on the timing of its next rate hike. In China, the country's manufacturing purchasing managers index flipped into expansion territory for the first time since April, with the National Bureau of Statistics revealing the manufacturing PMI came in at 50.1. This beat forecasts from a Reuters poll of economists, who expected the manufacturing PMI to come in at 49.9, a softer contraction than the 49.8 the month before.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was 0.5% lower after the BOJ decision, closing at 39,081.25 and snapping a three-day winning streak. The broad based Topix slipped 0.3%, also ending three straight days of gains and finishing at 2,695.51. South Korea's Kospi was 1.45% lower at 2,556.15, leading losses in Asia and hitting its lowest level since Sept. 11, but the small cap Kosdaq was up 0.66%, closing at 743.06. Investors are assessing heavyweight Samsung Electronics' third-quarter earnings, which revealed a lower profit than the previous quarter. Most notably, Samsung's semiconductor unit reported third-quarter operating profit of 3.86 trillion won (about $2.8 billion), down 40% from the previous quarter. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.25%, closing at 8,160 and hitting its lowest level since Oct. 4.

8,diplomat kate season russell ahn janney even make world rage,"The world is in flames, countries are at each others’ throats and politicians are screaming in rage.

No, I’m not talking about the 2024 presidential race, but rather the second season of Netflix’s Keri Russell political thriller, “The Diplomat” ( ★★★ out of four), aptly streaming now, at the climax of this election year.

Because if you’re the kind of person who wants distraction from the real world of politics with a fake one that has more ridiculous conspiracies and government officials in nice suits making flirty eyes at one another, “Diplomat” happily delivers. And it does so with the help of this year’s coup d’etat of a guest star: Allison Janney of “The West Wing” fame. If you want to level up from casting Russell, who played everyone’s favorite Russian spy for years on “The Americans,” you can really only do it with the likes of C.J. Cregg.

“Diplomat” Season 2 begins immediately after the big Season 1 cliffhanger, in which four characters were standing next to a car when it exploded on a London street. That's because ever since career foreign service officer Kate Wyler (Russell) took the job as U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom amid a crisis for our friends across the pond, things have gone from bad to worse.

Kate, her meddling husband Hal (Rufus Sewell) and U.K. foreign minister Austin Dennison (David Gyasi) have tried to uncover those responsible for an attack on a British aircraft carrier, and all signs point to an inside job involving Prime Minister Nicol Trowbridge (Rory Kinnear).

As Hal, Kate’s deputy Stuart (Ato Essandoh) and another embassy officer head into emergency surgery after getting caught in the blast, Kate and her CIA chief Eidra Park (Ali Ahn) try to unravel the conspiracy. They do so in the same messy, harried manner that Kate did everything in Season 1, but this time the stakes seem even higher. “Diplomat,"" like all the best talky thrillers, can make a cocktail party as tense as a battle scene. Each twist that unfolds feels both deeply shocking and inevitable.

Janney appears midseason as Vice President Grace Penn, who unexpectedly arrives in London and shakes things up in an aggressive manner that marks a deliberate callback to Janney’s “Wing” character. It is tantalizing to see the Emmy-winning actress dressed in pantsuits yelling at government officials again, so “Diplomat” gets points for the nostalgia bait as well as the very good plot twist that comes with her appearance (don’t worry, no spoilers here).

Aside from its guest star, everything that was great about “Diplomat” remains so, and even a smidge better. Russell is dynamic, magnetic and surprisingly hilarious, still the main draw even as her co-stars get deeper backstories and plots.

Sewell is a smarmy charmer all over again, only slightly humbled by his brush with death at the end of Season 1. And Ahn is a delightful standout as the unluckiest CIA station chief on the globe, as Eidra is dragged into Kate’s diplomatic kerfuffles, risking her career. Ahn gives her spy character a buttoned-up rage so convincing you might forget the same actress plays a free-spirit rocker witch on Disney+’s “Agatha All Along.” This time the material meets Ahn's talent.

“Diplomat” will never be a realistic representation of international relations, but the series is fun and engrossing. The pace is fast, and so is the dialogue. The characters are appealing and the actors are talented. The episodes aren’t too long and the settings are gorgeous. And the ludicrous twists of diplomacy that make up the roller-coaster plot only make it that much more addictive.

It might just be exactly the kind of political fantasy to match our current moment: it feels authentic and enthralling, but the developments are too outlandish to be a part of real life.

9,trump father harry us prince damn 4 queen said eric,"Eric Trump reckons Prince Harry need not worry about his US visa debacle — because no one in America “gives a damn” about him.

The ex-president’s second son, 40, had some scathing remarks about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, saying it’s “sad to watch” how the pair have “gone off the deep end.”

“Truthfully I don’t give a damn about Prince Harry and I don’t think this country does either,” Trump told the Daily Mail.

“My father loved the Queen and I think the monarchy is an incredibly beautiful thing.”

Trump said that should his father emerge victorious in the Nov. 5 election next week, Harry will not need to worry about being deported from the US.

“I don’t give a damn if he did drugs. It means nothing,” he said. “I can tell you that our father and our entire family has tremendous respect for the monarchy.”

Trump’s comments come a month after a judge ruled that the father of two’s visa application is to remain private.

Still, while Trump says his father isn’t looking to explore deporting Harry, it does not mean he’s fond of the exiled royal.

“You look at this one black sheep who doesn’t exactly know where he is, led by a wife that is pretty unpopular, both here and over where you are,” he said of the duke, who quit royal life in 2020 and moved to the US.

Trump added that the Sussexes “have gone off the deep end and it’s sad to watch,” adding that people are “able to differentiate between the two sides” of the monarchy.

“The late queen was amazing,” he said of Queen Elizabeth II, who died in November 2022 at age 96. “The way she welcomed my father with open arms was, like, beyond.”

Trump also praised the current monarch, King Charles III, who had previously visited the Trump family at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

“We’ve known the king forever,” Trump told the outlet. “In fact, I was just digging through a photo album not too long ago and I came across a picture of him with my father, I’m 6 years old in the lobby of Mar-a-Lago.”

Elsewhere, the son of the 45th US president showered the Prince and Princess of Wales with praise, saying the pair have never “made a misstep.”

The documentary, released Wednesday, looked back at Stewart’s life and hardships, including her 2004 Alderson Federal Prison Camp stint, which she claims should not have been the main focus of the movie’s second half.

“The trial and the actual incarceration was less than two years out of an 83-year life,” she said. “I considered it a vacation, to tell you the truth.”

The former self-made billionaire also blasted the documentary’s soundtrack, saying Cutler got “some lousy classical score in there, which has nothing to do with me.”

“I love the first half of the documentary. It gets into things that many people don’t know anything about, which is what I like about it,” the “Martha Stewart Living” founder told the outlet.

Reacting to Stewart’s scathing remarks, Cutler told the outlet that the documentary is “a movie, not a Wikipedia page.”

11,menendez brothers gascón clemency attorney office prison parole cnn district,"CNN —

Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón “strongly supports” Erik and Lyle Menendez’s bid for clemency and has written letters on behalf of each brother to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, he announced Wednesday.

The letters, published by Gascón’s office, describe the 1989 murders by the Menendez brothers of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, as well as “credible allegations” that Erik and Lyle were each “the victim of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of (their) father.”

The brothers’ 34 years spent in custody and “dedication to rehabilitation” make them “exemplary” candidates for clemency, Gascón wrote. The district attorney adds that his office has communicated with several family members of Kitty and Jose Menendez and all family members except one, Kitty Menendez’s brother, support commutation.

CNN has reached out to the brothers’ attorney, Mark Geragos, to confirm a formal clemency request has been sent to the governor’s office. Newsom’s office declined to comment on the case, saying “pending clemency applications are confidential and we’re not able to discuss individual cases.”

If approved by the governor, the Menendez brothers could see their sentence – life in prison without the possibility of parole – reduced, or they could be released immediately.

“I strongly support clemency for Erik and Lyle Menendez,” Gascón said in a statement Wednesday. “They have respectively served 34 years and have continued their educations and worked to create new programs to support the rehabilitation of fellow inmates.”

Gascon’s announcement comes days after the district attorney filed a motion recommending a judge resentence the siblings –– from life in prison without parole to life in prison with parole.

Under California law, the brothers would be immediately eligible for parole because they were 26 or younger when they committed their crimes.

A hearing for the resentencing request has been set for December 11, according to a court official and Holly Baird, a spokesperson for the brothers’ lawyer Mark Geragos.

“They were appropriately sentenced at the time when they were tried,” Gascón said in an earlier interview with CNN. “I just think that given the current state of the law and given our assessment of their behavior in prison, they deserve the opportunity to be reevaluated and perhaps reintegrated into the community.”",372,"parole, letters, brothers, lyle, menendez, clemency, attorney, support, la, district, sends, prison, gascón, office, county, requesting",2024-10-31
12,harris trump campaign president celebrities latino voters rally celebrity said,"CNN —

In September, Latin music superstar Nicky Jam appeared onstage with Donald Trump. Donning a red MAGA hat, the reggaeton singer told a Las Vegas rally that he was supporting the former president.

On Tuesday, he withdrew his endorsement – joining a chorus of famous Puerto Ricans who have condemned comments made by a comedian at Trump’s New York City rally earlier this week assailing the US island territory.

“Puerto Rico should be respected,” Nicky Jam told his 43 million Instagram followers.

While Jam didn’t endorse Harris in his post, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, reggaeton star Don Omar, “Despacito” singer Luis Fonsi and global superstar Bad Bunny are among the celebrities of Puerto Rican descent who have shown support for the vice president or her platform since Sunday. Lopez is also participating in a rally alongside Harris in Las Vegas on Thursday.

Harris campaign officials had always planned for star-studded events in the homestretch of the presidential election. But the influx of Latino artists denouncing Trump and showing up for Harris with voting already underway is the October surprise that the campaign didn’t see coming.

Together, those stars have a combined 390 million global followers on Instagram alone – more than the US population.

In a razor-thin race, celebrity support can move the needle, experts say, especially among a demographic with which polls have shown Trump closing the gap with Harris – Latino men – and especially at a time when both campaigns are vying for the Puerto Rican vote in battleground Pennsylvania, where there’s a sizable portion of Latino voters.

The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, with campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez saying in a statement after the rally, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”

Unexpected support

The support from Bad Bunny – born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio – came as a surprise to the Harris team, according to a campaign official.

Harris campaign officials had been in talks with Bad Bunny’s team and were cautiously optimistic he would back the vice president’s plans for Puerto Rico, according to a source familiar with discussions, but they didn’t expect him to weigh in Sunday, sharing on his social media a video of Harris’ plans for the island.

Bad Bunny has not generally weighed in on politics. A representative for the star told CNN that his repost of Harris’ video on Instagram was “not an endorsement” but that he is “supporting” the vice president because “Benito’s political focus has always been on Puerto Rico.”

For months, an endorsement from Bad Bunny had been at the top of the Harris campaign’s wish list, due to his influence on young male Latino voters, according to another source familiar with the campaign’s Hollywood outreach.

“They are cultural validators,” said one source close to the campaign, adding that actions from Latino artists garner coverage in Spanish media and help open discussions among the Latino community.

Another source described Latino celebrities weighing in for Harris as another way for the campaign to break through among Latinos at a time when polls suggest waning enthusiasm.

Harris pollster Matt Barreto, who focuses on Latino voters, argued that endorsements can help mobilize voters.

“Any sort of celebrity, influencer, famous person has the ability to attract attention and attract eyeballs,” Barreto said. “That, by itself, is a big positive. These are people who are recognized. To some extent, they are trusted.”

While celebrities alone get attention for name recognition, Barreto argued that voters need a reason to listen to them. That, he said, is one reason Sunday’s inflammatory comments about Puerto Rico has resulted in a snowball effect that has reached Latinos nationwide.

“This was all natural, and it helped amplify what the average person on the street was feeling,” he said.

“This is a very unique moment that will be talked about after the campaign and after the election for a long time. It is so much more powerful than the Latino community and, in any community, when you have celebrities and influencers and everyday people all reacting in real time similarly to such an offense,” he added.

A Hollywood political strategist who has been working with many A-listers this election cycle agrees that authenticity is key, especially as the reach of celebrities and is evolving.

“A few years ago, celebrities took the approach of more is more. That’s not it. You have to focus on the right people in the right places and align the people with the right issues and the right message,” the strategist said. “Followers need to believe it.”

Both campaigns utilize the power of celebrity

Ever since Harris’ campaign kicked off with Charli XCX’s lime green stamp of approval, Hollywood’s influence has been in the spotlight.

The British pop star’s “kamala IS brat” endorsement catapulted Harris into Gen Z territory at the very start of her campaign this summer, validating her candidacy among legions of young voters and turning the vice president into a pop culture meme icon.

Charli XCX’s endorsement came as a surprise to the Harris campaign, but it leaned in hard, flooding TikTok with lime green, coconut tree emojis and music from another Gen Z pop star, Chappell Roan, in an effort to reach younger voters.

Taylor Swift’s September endorsement of Harris, moments after the presidential debate, also came as a surprise to the vice president’s campaign. Both Harris and Trump swiftly pounced on the “Swiftie” fanbase, showcasing the pop superstar’s immense reach: The Harris campaign created Harris-Walz friendship bracelets inspired by the singer, while the Trump campaign released Eras Tour-inspired T-shirts.

The list of celebrities and musicians backing Harris has only grown – ranging from music legends Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen, who have performed at Harris events in Georgia, to the stars of Marvel’s “Avengers” movies, who backed the vice president on social media Thursday.

And as Election Day nears, the Harris campaign is bringing in more A-listers to mobilize people to vote, including a long-anticipated appearance by Beyoncé last week.

“We’ll use all the tools at our disposal,” a senior campaign official previously told CNN.

Trump later mocked his opponent for having a “dance party with Beyoncé,” suggesting that Harris was more focused on celebrities than on everyday Americans.

But the former president, too, is enlisting celebrity support during this critical time. On Wednesday night, hall of fame Packers quarterback Brett Favre returned to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to join Trump’s latest rally. TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw delivered remarks at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, as did tech magnate Elon Musk.

As CNN previously reported, a recent Harvard study found that celebrity endorsements do play an influential role in promoting civic participation.

As voters get out to the polls, a wide range of stars have made recent endorsements. Some have been predictable like Oscar winner and longtime environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio, who spoke about Harris’ commitment to climate change and said that Trump “continues to deny the facts.” Others have been more surprising, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California who announced his support for Harris, calling Trump “unpatriotic.”

“I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians,” Schwarzenegger wrote Wednesday on X. “I will always be an American before I am a Republican.”

Representatives for Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on whether his post came organically or was done in coordination with the Harris campaign.

A celebrity publicist told CNN that, like the past two elections, many of his left-leaning clients have been driven to take a stance against Trump, even more so than to show support for another candidate.

“A lot of it has been driven by Trump. When it comes down to it, do you all want Trump to be the president or not? That’s a very motivating thing,” the publicist said. “The Trump phenomenon is far more powerful as an organizer than most things.”

But on the other side of the aisle, Trump has more public celebrity supporters than ever before.

His longtime Hollywood fans include Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammer and Roseanne Barr, and country singers such as Jason Aldean and John Rich are also backing him. But this year, actors, including Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi and Mel Gibson, have publicly endorsed Trump, as have athletes such as Mike Tyson and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.

Trump has been unique in his multifaceted celebrity approach, targeting hugely popular social media stars and podcasters, who arguably wield more influence than most Hollywood celebrities. His hour-and-a-half livestream with 24-year-old gamer Adin Ross garnered millions more eyeballs than any traditional news network could, as did his recent conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan, which currently has more than 40 million views.

“I wouldn’t over-index celebrities, but in a really close election in certain states and districts where elections are going to be won by less than 500 voters, you want to play all of your cards,” the Hollywood political strategist said.

14,yorke radiohead gaza israel singer australian heckler crowd israeli said,"Radiohead singer confronts Gaza protester at Australian gig

Watch: Radiohead's Thom Yorke responds to heckler shouting about Gaza

""Don't stand there like a coward, come here and say it. You want to piss on everybody's night? Ok you do it, see you later,"" Yorke continues, before removing his guitar and halting his set.

Yorke responds by telling the heckler to ""hop up on stage"" to make his remarks.

Videos posted online by concert-goers at the Melbourne show on Wednesday show a man in the crowd shouting at Yorke. While not all of his words can be heard, he calls on the singer to ""condemn the Israeli genocide of Gaza"".

Radiohead singer Thom Yorke briefly walked off stage during his Australian solo tour after an exchange with an audience member who heckled him with a protest about deaths in Gaza.

His exit came as the heckler had repeated his call and added ""how many dead children will it take"".

Segments of the crowd could be heard booing the disturbance, and Yorke returned to cheers shortly after to play the Radiohead song Karma Police.

Concert-goer Elly Brus said the protester ""did not have support"" from the Sidney Myer Music Bowl crowd.

“He was escorted away by security. He then continued to engage with people outside the venue as well,"" she told the BBC.

Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage.

More than 43,160 people have been killed in Gaza since then - including thousands of women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Both sides deny accusations they have broken the laws of war.

In the past, Radiohead has faced pressure to cancel shows in Israel and take part in a cultural boycott of the country over its policies towards the Palestinians.

Yorke pushed back on that pressure, saying that ""playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government"".

""We've played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others,"" Yorke said in a statement in 2017, defending a decision to go ahead with a planned concert in Tel Aviv.

""We don't endorse [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them,"" he added at the time.

Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian activists also accused Yorke's bandmate Jonny Greenwood of ""artwashing"" for performing alongside Israeli-Arabic musician Dudu Tassa in Tel Aviv.

""No art is as 'important' as stopping all the death and suffering around us,"" Greenwood said in a statement on X.

""But... silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn't seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict.""

The BBC has contacted representatives for Yorke's Australian tour.

16,said israel lebanon gaza minister condition hamas hezbollah prime northern,"Senior Biden administration officials met Thursday with Israel’s prime minister and defense minister in an effort to secure a cease-fire in Lebanon as Israel’s strikes on its northern neighbor continued.

Amos Hochstein, the White House envoy for Lebanon, and Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and Africa, were working toward a deal that would allow residents of southern Lebanon and northern Israel to return their homes, said a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.

They also discussed efforts for the release of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, the official said. Hochstein was on his way back to Washington following the meetings, said another U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Biden officials that Israel’s priority was to “thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,” according to a statement from the prime minister’s office. Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel have forced residents there to evacuate.

Lebanon’s prime minister, Najib Mikati, said in a televised interview Wednesday he had been skeptical that a cease-fire could be reached before the U.S. election, but that after speaking with Hochstein shortly before the interview, he believed that “maybe we can reach a cease-fire in the next few days.” He also said that Hezbollah had agreed to “separate the Lebanese front from Gaza,” referring to Hezbollah’s longtime condition that the group would agree to a truce in Lebanon only after a cease-fire was reached in the Gaza Strip.

Mikati’s optimistic assessment contrasted with comments made by Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, who said in a speech Wednesday that there was not yet a cease-fire proposal “that Israel agrees to and that is open for us to discuss.” People familiar with the negotiations over the last few months, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Hezbollah had agreed to a cease-fire before an Israeli strike killed its former leader, Hasan Nasrallah, in late September.

Separately, William J. Burns, director of the CIA, met in Cairo on Thursday with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi. The two discussed “efforts to achieve de-escalation in the Gaza Strip” and “ways to advance negotiations toward a cease-fire and the exchange of captives,” Sisi’s office said in a statement.

A member of Hamas’s political bureau stated that the group had recently received multiple cease-fire proposals, all of which were rejected. The Hamas official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly, said, “Hamas’s position is firm, the demands are clear, and none of the proposals include a final cease-fire or a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.”

He said there was “no room for partial solutions,” adding that Hamas’s conditions were “a full cessation of hostilities, the return of displaced persons to northern Gaza, the withdrawal of occupying forces, a clear reconstruction plan and a fair prisoner exchange.”",508,"hits, idf, prime, speaking, ceasefire, north, visit, functioning, official, lebanon, hospital, say, officials, discuss, gaza, israel, northern, gazas, condition, minister",2024-10-31
17,bus said police los angeles dodgers win people set fire,"A bus was set on fire, shops were looted and fireworks were thrown at police in scenes of lawlessness and ""absolute chaos"" in downtown Los Angeles following the Dodgers' World Series win over the New York Yankees on Wednesday night.

Los Angeles police said at 10:43 p.m. (1:43 a.m. ET Thursday) on X that there were reports of several stores being looted on Broadway and 8th Street. Various videos posted to social media, including one shared by the official police X account, showed people walking out of a Nike store holding goods.

A dozen people were arrested in connection with the disturbances, police said. Six people were taken into custody on suspicion of commercial burglary, four of receiving stolen property and two others of failure to disperse.

Police issued a dispersal order because of fireworks and projectiles being thrown at officers. Then a ""hostile crowd"" surrounded a bus on Echo Park Avenue, a short distance from Dodger Stadium, at around 12:35 a.m. and set it on fire, police said.

The driver and five passengers managed to leave the bus before the fire started, the transit authority said.

18,election musk x officials cnn said state misinformation claims benson,"CNN —

Elon Musk’s misinformation megaphone has created a “huge problem” for election officials in key battleground states who told CNN they’re struggling to combat the wave of falsehoods coming from the tech billionaire and spreading wildly on his X platform.

Election officials in pivotal battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona have all tried – and largely failed – to fact-check Musk in real time. At least one has tried passing along personal notes asking he stop spreading baseless claims likely to mislead voters.

“I’ve had my friends hand-deliver stuff to him,” said Stephen Richer, a top election official in Arizona’s Maricopa County, a Republican who has faced violent threats for saying the 2020 election was secure.

“We’ve pulled out more stops than most people have available to try to put accurate information in front of (Musk),” Richer added. “It has been unsuccessful.”

Ever since former President Donald Trump and his allies trumpeted bogus claims of election fraud to try to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in 2020, debunking election misinformation has become akin to a second full-time job for election officials, alongside administering actual elections. But Musk – with his ownership of the X platform, prominent backing of Trump and penchant for spreading false claims – has presented a unique challenge.

“The bottom line is it’s really disappointing that someone with as many resources and as big of a platform as he clearly has would use those resources and allow that platform to be misused to spread misinformation,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told CNN, “when he could help us restore and ensure people can have rightly placed faith in our election outcomes, whatever they may be.”

Benson has come the closest to matching Musk on social media. She pushed back on a claim he made about registered voters in the Wolverine State, accusing Musk of spreading misinformation. Her post, by the measurement posted on X, gained more than 33 million views.

It still failed to sway Musk, who accused Benson of “blatantly lying to the public.”

Such is the conundrum for officials in key battleground states six days before Election Day: They haven’t identified how to neuter the misinformation Musk has increasingly amplified to his 200 million followers and allowed to permeate on the X, formerly known as Twitter, platform with little intervention.

A spokesperson for X did not address Musk’s activities but said X is enforcing its policies related to election interference and misleading content.

CNN has sent questions about election officials’ concerns to an email address associated with Musk. CNN has also requested comment from one of Musk’s attorneys.

Election officials say they are simply outmatched up against Musk’s followers and the X algorithm.

“Election officials, they have a very hard job – their job is to be election officials not to be Tweeters,” said Renée DiResta, an expert in disinformation and an associate research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy.

“If no algorithm is going to boost your content in any way but it is boosting the contents of prominent people who are deeply suspicious of elections and tweeting conspiracy theories, you’re at a structural disadvantage,” DiResta added.

This week Musk directed his followers to report election irregularities to an “Election Integrity Community” on X. The feed is administered by Musk’s America PAC, which is bolstering Trump’s campaign. The feed included some election claims that had already been debunked by state officials.

“It’s just a staggering situation with him at the helm,” said Nina Jankowicz, CEO of the American Sunlight Project, which aims to expose disinformation. “I don’t know if anything can fact-check him.”

Personal and security risks

Benson said her strategy of trying to fact-check Musk on X comes with a personal risk.

“The first time he attacked our election system, I had to take a beat and realize that if I were to respond as I did, ultimately, I’d have to check to make sure my family was safe first, and I’d called my security team and let them know to expect an uptick in threats and all the rest, and that’s very real,” she told CNN.

“But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try consistently, with the truth on our side, to make sure the facts get out there,” Benson added.

Benson also said her team has attempted to find unique ways to get accurate information about the election out to voters in Michigan by empowering trusted messengers to share it. This week, her office gathered business and labor leaders to brief them on how the state ensures every valid vote is tabulated on election night and beyond.

Election officials in Pennsylvania are similarly attempting to fact-check Musk’s false claims on X but acknowledge those efforts are unlikely to stymie the spread of election lies.

“Elon Musk is a huge problem,” one Pennsylvania election official said. The official told CNN the strategy at this point is more about “creating a paper trail” that various claims have been debunked should they appear in any post-election legal challenges as they did in 2020.

Musk is also making headlines in Pennsylvania as he is trying to move a lawsuit over his $1 million giveaway to voters into federal court, potentially averting a hearing Thursday in Philadelphia state court that he was required to attend. At the center of the legal battle is a daily $1 million sweepstakes that Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC, called America PAC, is offering to registered voters in battleground states.

His lawyers filed a “motion of removal” in federal court late Wednesday night. This typically pauses the state case and puts the matter in the hands of a federal judge – unless and until that judge decides to send the case back to state courts.

In Georgia, election officials see little point in trying to engage with Musk directly, instead turning to the method they relied on in 2020 to beat back misinformation: Regular press conferences with election officials rebutting the latest election falsehoods.

The conservative backlash against social media companies monitoring platforms for misleading information around elections has had a chilling effect on social media sites beyond X. But an official in one battleground state said they at least have a point of contact for companies like Meta, whereas executives at X are effectively unreachable.

For experts like Jankowicz, who has been criticized by Republicans and was called to testify before Republican House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan’s so-called weaponization of government subcommittee, it’s a dark irony that they’ve been silent on Musk’s activism.

“What Elon Musk is doing – the campaigning that he’s doing, the donations that he is making, the way he has engineered Twitter to be a maelstrom of conservative disinformation – is far closer to election interference than any of the allegations that conservatives have made against social media platforms from 2016 to 2022,”Jankowicz said.

Among Democrats on Capitol Hill, there is concern that social media platforms are wholly unprepared for the deluge of misinformation about voting in the days before and after Election Day.

“I don’t feel I’ve got a full answer yet from the platforms themselves of what they’re going to do to surge capabilities both those last few days pre-election and the few days post-election,” Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the intelligence committee, told CNN.

At a September 18 hearing Warner’s committee held on foreign election influence and social media firms, X was conspicuously absent.

“Our invited witness was X’s Head of Global Affairs, Nick Pickles, who resigned on September 6,” an X spokesperson said via email. The spokesperson did not reply when CNN asked why the company did not send someone to the hearing in Pickles’ place.

19,trump campaign new world series dodgers states harris two musk,"Donald Trump takes his campaign to New Mexico, one of several blue-state stops. The Los Angeles Dodgers take home a World Series title. And a trip underground to see a 600-ton sphere that scientists hope will help unlock the universe’s mysteries.

Here’s what to know today.

Trump’s unconventional final-week campaign stops

New Mexico. Virginia. New Hampshire. They're states where former President Donald Trump is trailing Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 5 points in recent polls, where he lost by double digits in 2020 and where the GOP nominee for president hasn't been elected in two decades. Yet Trump is lined up to host rallies in the first two states and is flirting with a trip to the third. A visit to Albuquerque, New Mexico, is on the agenda today.

This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.

The visits to these states in the final week of the presidential campaign seem to show the Trump campaign is confident that he is in such good shape to beat Vice President Kamala Harris that he can afford to divert focus from the seven main battleground states the two sides have focused on for the entirety of the race. Harris, in comparison, is scheduled to visit Phoenix today, as well as Reno and Las Vegas.

However, both candidates campaigned in coveted battleground Wisconsin yesterday, where Harris tied to court young voters while Trump donned an orange vest and climbed into a garbage truck to highlight comments made by President Joe Biden a day earlier. (Harris also spoke out against Biden's comments.)

A Trump campaign official said the visits to non-battleground states are part of a strategy to capitalize on what the campaign says are Trump’s diverse coalition and favorable positioning on the map. Another Trump campaign official said that if it is going to a state, it’s because the campaign sees movement there.

But questions are swirling about whether Trump’s campaign is high on its own supply or grounded in a reality that public polls have missed. The unexpected destinations, plus Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally last weekend in deep-blue New York, has led some Republicans to infer that Trump is overruling the political pros on his team.

Read the full story here.

More election coverage:

➡️ With the presidential election looking extremely close in polls, it’s possible results could hinge on a recount in a battleground state. Here’s how the process works in seven key states. Plus, how ballot-counting rules differ across these states.

➡️ Trump said in a campaign rally speech that he would “protect” women, “whether the women like it or not.”

➡️ Trump and his allies are calling out routine election processes as signs of fraud in Pennsylvania. The playbook is familiar.

➡️ Reggaeton star Nicky Jam backtracked on his endorsement of Trump over the Puerto Rico “garbage” joke made at a rally last weekend.

➡️ Backers of Nikki Haley are turned off by Trump’s harsh and sometimes racist rhetoric. But for some, their dislike of Harris is stronger.

➡️ Haley, meanwhile, told voters at stops in Pennsylvania to put aside their feelings about Trump and “focus on the policies.”

➡️ An officer who fought off a pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6 and was also on duty for Harris’ speech this week at The Ellipse compared the two events: “Didn’t do that on the 6th.”

How Elon Musk turned X into a pro-Trump echo chamber

Before Elon Musk owned X, the app then known as Twitter was regarded as a global town square. When Musk offered to buy the app in April 2022, he pledged that the platform wouldn’t take sides in politics. It hasn’t worked out that way.

Musk has transformed the platform into an echo chamber in the two years since his purchase. Right-leaning causes are amplified, in particular former President Donald Trump’s electoral campaign, according to academic research, public opinion surveys, data on X’s most influential users, engagement metrics and reports about X’s working directly with the Trump campaign. And in recent months, Musk has become one of Trump’s biggest donors and supporters.

All told, Musk’s structural changes to the app have tilted in favor of far-right users and posts, researchers say. Look back at how Musk has reshaped the platform under his leadership.

Los Angeles Dodgers win the World Series

The Los Angeles Dodgers are 2024 champions after winning Game 5 of the World Series in a thrilling 7-6 win against the New York Yankees. The Yankees appeared to be cruising toward a victory, leading 5-0 headed into what would end up being a consequential fifth inning. Instead, the team made three huge fielding mistakes that allowed the Dodgers to tie up the game. Here’s what happened.

New York retook the lead in the sixth inning, but two sacrifice flies by Los Angeles in the top of the eighth inning put the Dodgers in the lead for good.

This marks the Dodgers’ second World Series in the last five years. First baseman Freddie Freeman won World Series MVP. It also marks a first World Series for superstar Shohei Ohtani. Relive highlights from last night’s game.

Floods kill at least 95 in Spain

More downpours are in the forecast today in Spain, a day after at least 95 people were killed and many others are still missing after torrential rain in parts of the country, local authorities said. It’s the country’s worst natural disaster in nearly 30 years and the deadliest rain event in Europe since 2021.

Some areas recorded nearly 8 inches of rain that turned roads into rivers and disrupted highways and railway lines. One town got more than 19 inches of rain in just eight hours. Here’s what else we know.

Staff Pick: The race to solve a scientific mystery

Journalists take pictures at the top of the sphere at the Underground Neutrino Observatory, in Jiangmen, Guangdong province, China on Oct. 11. Eric Baculinao / NBC News

Some 2,300 feet below the Earth’s surface in China is a 600-ton plexiglass sphere that looks like something from a sci-fi flick. Soon, Chinese scientists will fill the sphere with liquid, seal it shut and never open it again, in hopes that they’ll catch a glimpse of the tiniest particles known to physicists: neutrinos. The sphere is meant to usher in a new wave of international research that could untangle the last mysteries of the Big Bang or identify new phenomena in physics.

Earlier this month, Beijing-based producer Eric Baculinao went to southern China and traveled deep underground for an up-close look at the 13-story sphere before it was too late. This story gave me the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with our Beijing bureau so we could share the story of Eric’s unique and rare journey. — Evan Bush, science reporter

Jennifer Lopez asks Puerto Ricans, Latinos to support Harris

Jennifer Lopez, Puerto Rican Grammy-winning singer and actress, called on voters – especially Latino and women voters – to cast their ballots for Vice President Kamala Harris, saying the Democratic presidential nominee cares about “not just some Americans, but all Americans.”

“I believe in the power of our community,” Lopez said of Latino voters during Harris’ rally at the Craig Ranch Amphitheater in Las Vegas. “I believe in the power of all our votes. I believe that together we are the difference in this election. I know that together we are the difference in this election.”

The comments come after former President Donald Trump fell under fire after a comedian at his Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” Although Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, tried to distance himself from the racist joke, he was met with backlash from Puerto Rican and other Latino voters.

Lopez criticized the offensive joke, saying “it wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day. It was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character.”

Record turnout in Georgia? 50% of active voters have cast ballots

As of Thursday, more than 50% of active Georgia voters – about 3.7 million – have already cast their ballots in the Peach State, according to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office. Thursday was the seventeenth day of early voting, and the office said it expects turnout to increase on Friday, the last early voting day.

The current tally dwarfs early voting numbers from Day 17 in the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections, which were about 1.5 million, 2.3 million, and 1.9 million respectively, according to a Thursday press release.

The updated figure marks a continuation of what Raffensperger has described as record-breaking early turnout numbers: ""Georgia voters are smashing through every voting record, with more than 3 million for in-person early voting turnout, which is unprecedented in Georgia history,"" Raffensperger said at a press conference Wednesday.

Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer within Raffensperger’s office, suggested Wednesday that, with early turnout so high, Election Day polling places could be a ""ghost town.""

Vance jabs Biden, says he's 'trying to help' Trump win

JD Vance suggested during an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast that Joe Biden is “trying to help” Donald Trump win the election after the president’s “garbage” comments earlier this week. The president appeared to call Trump's supporters ""garbage,"" but he later said he was only talking about a comedian who told insulting jokes at a Trump rally over the weekend.

“After we win, I'm gonna be convinced that Joe Biden was trying to help us the whole time,” Vance said, referencing a moment where Biden jokingly put on a Trump 2024 hat during a visit to Pennsylvania.

Earlier, Vance told Rogan that he’d bet $20 that Biden was planning to vote for Trump and $100 that his son, Hunter Biden, would also back the Republican nominee over Kamala Harris. Biden immediately endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.

Harris ponders late mother's advice

Vice President Kamala Harris reflected at a stop in Phoenix on Thursday about what her late mother would think of her campaign for president against Donald Trump.

In an interview with NBC News, Harris was asked what advice her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, would give her in the final days of the days of the campaign.

“Just go beat him. That’s probably what she’d say,” Harris said. Laughing, she added, “Yeah, that’s my mother.”

Harris has credited her mother as a major influence on her life. Shyamala Gopalan, who came alone to the United States from India when she was 19, was a biomedical scientist who wanted to cure breast cancer. She died in 2009.

Trump sues CBS News over '60 Minutes' interview of Harris

Trump has filed a long-shot damages lawsuit against CBS News over the editing of a ""60 Minutes"" interview of Harris.

The lawsuit accuses the network of ""voter interference through malicious, deceptive, and substantial news distortion calculated to confuse, deceive, and mislead the public."" Don't expect the lawsuit to go anywhere. Networks routinely edit taped interviews of newsmakers.

In this case, there was no effort to deceive, CBS said. In an Oct. 20 statement, 60 Minutes said it ""gave an excerpt of our interview to 'Face the Nation' that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer.""

Protesters against the war in the Gaza Strip interrupted Kamala Harris several times Thursday while she was speaking at campaign rally in Phoenix.

A protester started shouting about five minutes into Harris’s speech but was quickly hustled out as the crowd chanted “Kamala.” Over the next few minutes, other protesters began shouting, prompting a response from the vice president.

“Let’s talk for a moment about Gaza,” she said. “We all want this war to end and the hostages home. I will work on it full time when I am elected president, as I’ve been.”

Trump announces he would create new Cabinet post aimed at reducing costs

Trump said at a rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday that he would create a new Cabinet position aimed at reducing the cost of living if he wins a second term.

“I will create a new Cabinet position for a senior member of my administration who will be tasked exclusively with doing everything in the federal government’s power to reduce the cost of living,” he said.

He added that on day one of his presidency, he would sign an executive order that would direct every federal agency to remove regulations that are “driving up the cost of goods,” but didn’t provide specific government regulations he'd target.

Basketball legend LeBron James endorses Harris

Basketball superstar LeBron James added his name to the list of celebrities from the sports and entertainment worlds who are endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.

The Los Angeles Lakers legend posted a video Thursday evening on the social media platform X featuring some of the disparaging remarks Harris’s opponent, Republican Donald Trump, has made over the years, including his claim that immigrants “are poisoning the blood of our country” and that the country would be “like Detroit” if Harris wins. The video also shows footage of protesters and Trump saying he’d like to punch them in the face.

“What are we even talking about here??” James wrote on X. “When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!”

Stormy Daniels honored in Salem with witch award

Practicing witches gathered in Salem, Mass. on Thursday to honor adult film actress Stormy Daniels with a new award, according to the Boston Globe.

The group of witches, who gather in the spooky New England town every Halloween for their annual ""magic circle,"" gave Daniels the first ever ""Salem’s Witches’ Woman of Power Award."" They said she was the victim of a modern-day witch hunt.

Daniels was at the center of Donald Trump's New York hush money trial earlier this year. Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in an effort to hide hush money payments to Daniels, who has alleged that they had an affair.

""I can't find the words to explain emotionally how big this is to me,"" Daniels told the Globe. ""No one understands what the last six years have been like for me... The persecution those witches felt hundreds of years ago feels very familiar to me.""

Trump aide: RFK Jr. will not be in charge of health agencies

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Trump “promised” to put him in charge of public health agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Trump's transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick said Wednesday Kennedy would be in no such position.

“He’s not getting a job for HHS,” Lutnick told CNN.

""He's not going to be the (HHS) secretary, no,"" he added. ""That's not what he wants to do.”

Kennedy, a former 2024 presidential candidate, has earned a reputation for being anti-vaccine and spreading COVID-19 related conspiracy theories. Lutnick said Wednesday that Kennedy's real goal was not a cabinet position, but rather access to data from these agencies in an attempt to paint vaccines as unsafe and take them off the market.

Trump again claims to be 'father of IVF'

Trump went a little more than 90 minutes Thursday in Nevada, bashing Harris, attacking immigration policy, and - twice - claiming parentage of in vitro fertilization (IVF).

""I feel like I'm the father of IVF,"" Trump said at one point during the rally at Henderson, Nevada, near Las Vegas; a little more than an hour later, he said that ""I'm like the father of IVF.""

Trump's comments, echoes of a joke he made at a Fox News town hall earlier this month, again drew rebukes from Democrats who say that Republican anti-abortion policies threaten IVF.

""IVF is under threat across the country because Trump ended Roe v. Wade and his Project 2025 plan could effectively ban IVF altogether,"" said an X post from the Harris campaign rapid response unit.

Trump said Democrats are lying about his support for IVF, and that he wants the government or insurance companies to cover the costs of IVF treatments.

‘Stay tuned’: Undated absentee ballots in Pennsylvania remain center of court fight

A Pennsylvania court ruled that absentee ballots in Philadelphia with missing or incorrect dates should be counted in the Nov. 5 election despite a prohibition in state law, but advocates are waiting for the final word on the dispute from the state Supreme Court.

The stakes are potentially significant in the key swing state because 2.1 million requests for absentee ballots were approved and nearly 1.5 million have been returned through Wednesday, according to state Secretary of State Al Schmidt.

The portion with missing or wrong dates won't be known until the ballots are processed, but advocates say mistakes are decreasing as problems with the ballots are publicized.

Vance says he went home to 'load all my guns' after Trump was shot

When Donald Trump was shot in the ear at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, JD Vance, his soon-to-be running mate, was mini-golfing with his family in Cincinnati. Vance told the story on Joe Rogan's podcast, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" on Thursday.

""I actually thought they had killed him because when you first see the video he grabs his ear and then he goes down,"" Vance recalled after seeing the video of Trump's July 13 rally. ""I'm like, 'Oh my God, they just killed him.'""

After seeing the video, the Ohio senator said he brought his family back to their Cincinnati home and grabbed his guns.

""At first I was so pissed, but then I go into like fight or flight mode with my kids... We were at a mini golf place in Cincinnati, Ohio. I grab my kids up, throw them in the car, go home and load all my guns. And basically stand like a sentry in our front door, and that was my reaction to it,"" he said.

Kerry Washington, Bon Jovi to headline Kamala Harris campaign rally in North Carolina

Actress Kerry Washington and musician Jon Bon Jovi set to headline a Harris campaign rally Saturday in Charlotte, North Carolina, three days before Election Day.

Washington, star of the television series “Scandal,” will speak at the rally, dubbed “When we vote we win,” while Bon Jovi is among a slate of musical acts that also includes Brittney Spencer, Khalid and The War and Treaty.

Washington made an appearance at the Democratic National Convention in August, and Bon Jovi has also endorsed the Democratic nominee.

The Harris campaign has worked to move North Carolina, which has 16 electoral votes up for grabs, back to the Democratic column for the first time since Barack Obama carried the state in 2008.

Trump visits New Mexico − a long shot state

Trump began a western swing Thursday in a state that is more of a long shot than a battleground: New Mexico. At the start of an airport rally in Albuquerque, Trump said advisers told him ""you can't win New Mexico,"" but he disagreed.

""We can win New Mexico,"" Trump said; he acknowledged he lost the state in both of his previous elections, but claimed without evidence that those votes were ""rigged.""

Pollsters don't give Trump much of a chance in the Land of Enchantment. Real Clear Politics' average of New Mexico polls has Harris with a solid lead over Trump, 49.7% to 42.3%. New Mexico has only 5 electoral votes, but that could be enough to decide a close election.

GOP backlash after Mark Cuban says Trump is 'never' around 'strong, intelligent women'

Billionaire and Harris-Walz campaign surrogate Mark Cuban told 'The View' on Thursday morning that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is intimidated by ""strong, intelligent women,"" saying that's why he has a soured relationship with former GOP candidate Nikki Haley.

""Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women, ever,"" Cuban said. ""He doesn't like to be challenged by them, and, you know (Haley) will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can't have her around, it wouldn't work.""

Cuban's comments quickly garnered backlash from Republicans, claiming they were rooted in misogyny and divisive politics.

""@mcuban this is extremely insulting to the thousands of women who work for President Trump, and the tens of millions of women who are proudly voting for him. These women are mothers, entrepreneurs, and industry leaders. And yes, we are strong AND intelligent! #WomenForTrump,"" Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign national press secretary said on X Thursday.

Dodgers (and Chiefs) win 2024 sports titles: Good omens for Harris?

The Los Angeles Dodgers became baseball champions Wednesday night by wrapping up the World Series - and some sports astrologists think that's a good omen for California native Kamala Harris.

After all, the Dodgers last won the World Series in 2020, days before Donald Trump lost that year's presidential election. But wait sports fans: There's more.

In February, the Kansas City Chiefs won football's Super Bowl - just like they did in 2020.

Democratic strategist Ally Sammarco on the X social media site put it this way:

""2020: Chiefs win the Super Bowl ... Dodgers win the World Series ... Donald Trump loses the election

2024: Chiefs win the Super Bowl ... Dodgers win the World Series ... ????""

Co-conspirator in Trump Georgia 2020 election interference case has law license suspended

A New York court suspended Kenneth Chesebro's law license on Thursday based on his guilty plea in former President Donald Trump's Georgia criminal case. Chesebro pleaded guilty in 2023 to a single felony, conspiring to file false documents, as part of a deal that requires him to do community service and testify against other defendants.

Nineteen defendants, including Trump, were originally charged in the sweeping indictment brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Chesebro is one of four to plead guilty so far.

Prosecutors alleged Chesebro created and distributed false documents in Georgia and elsewhere to help people pose as presidential electors in an effort to reverse President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.

In trying to protect his New York law license, Chesebro argued that the outcome in his Georgia case isn't yet final. He cited the Georgia judge overseeing his case, who said that under the state's First Offender Act Chesebro will be ""completely exonerated of guilt"" once he completes his five-year probation sentence.

But a group of five New York judges rejected that argument.

""In our view, it is of no moment that respondent may ultimately be 'exonerated' under Georgia law, as it (is just) as plausible that he may violate the terms of his probation and be subjected to additional criminal penalties as a result,"" they wrote.

The suspension isn't necessarily permanent. The judges directed Chesebro to make his case down the line for why they shouldn't enter a final order of suspension.

Waiting on Pennsylvania Supreme Court for status of undated absentee ballots

Absentee ballots that are undated or have incorrect dates will be counted in Philadelphia, under a state court decision Wednesday. But Republicans are expected to appeal the ruling and advocates are waiting to see what the state Supreme Court will do.

The case at stake involved 69 ballots with missing or incorrect dates from a September special election for state House seats. Judge Ellen Ceisler wrote for the 3-2 majority the ballots should be counted despite “meaningless dating provisions” in state law.

But Judge Matthew Wolf, who disagreed with the ruling, wrote that the decision risked causing confusion on the eve of the general election.

The Republican National Committee is expected to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case because the high court already ruled in September that undated ballots should not be counted.

Marian Schneider, senior policy counsel for voting rights at the ACLU in Pennsylvania, said election officials in Philadelphia, which was a party to the lawsuit, expect to count absentee ballots on Election Day despite missing or incorrect dates unless the high court acts. She said the dispute could be resolved after the election.

“Stay tuned,” Schneider said. “I do not expect this to be the last word on this issue. To the extent that it’s not resolved before the election, there will probably be proceedings after the election with regard to specific provisional ballots.”

‘Get pissed off’: Vance makes closing argument to young voters

At a town hall in North Carolina, Vance offered the crowd of High Point University students this closing message: “You should be pissed off.”

“And why should you be pissed off?” Vance said. “You should be pissed off because you’re the first generation in the history of the United States of America that is unlikely to be able to own a home, that is unlikely to be able to earn a wage on which you can raise a family, that is more likely to be indebted than you are to accumulate wealth.”

The Republican vice presidential candidate focused on the economy, including high costs of living and college tuition debt, in his address to students Thursday morning. Vance also fielded questions from the young voters related to immigration and public safety.

“We can make a different policy choice, but only if you guys get pissed off about the position you’ve been put in and vote for a change in leadership,” Vance said.

Walz attempts to court male voters in Pennsylvania amid notable gender gap

At a campaign rally in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, Walz directly called out undecided male voters in his speech asking them to “think about the women in your lives you love.”

“This election literally is about their lives,” he said, referring to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. “Their lives are at stake in this election.”

Walz’s comments come as the Harris campaign is trying to address a notable gender gap. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that women decisively Harris, 53% to 36%, while men overwhelmingly support Trump, 53% to 37%.

The Minnesota governor also criticized comments Trump made at a rally in Wisconsin last night where the former president vowed to protect women “whether the women like it or not.”

“We trust women to make their own decisions. We trust them to go to their doctors. We trust them to make these types of decisions,” said Walz.

“Here's what's going to happen on Tuesday. They are going to send a loud and clear message to Donald Trump on Nov. 5. They're going to send that message whether he likes it or not,” Walz added in his speech.

Harris: ‘Very offensive to women’ that Trump said he would protect women whether they ‘like or not’

Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters Thursday that Donald Trump’s vow to protect women “whether the women like it or not” was a “very offensive” statement.

“It actually is, I think, very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies,” Harris told reporters on Thursday.

The Harris campaign has capitalized on Trump’s comments, releasing an ad hours after Trump made those remarks on Wednesday.

Trump during his rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday said that he wants to protect women, something he said his advisors urged him to not say.

“I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not,” Trump said. “I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles.”

Harris also said Trump will repeal the Affordable Care Act, pointing to comments House Speaker Mike Johnson made this week where he said there will be ""no Obamacare"" if Trump and congressional Republicans win the upcoming election on Nov. 5. Trump during this election cycle has vowed to improve upon the ACA but avoided proposing any specific policies.

“He is not going to be fighting for women's reproductive rights,” Harris concluded. “He does not prioritize the freedom of women and the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives and health care for all Americans is on the line in this election as well.”

Josh Shapiro rebuts Trump, promises secure Pennsylvania election

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro promised a free and fair election after Donald Trump amplified claims of voter fraud in the state.

""They've already started cheating,"" Trump told the crowd at a rally in Allenstown Tuesday.

On social media this week, the GOP nominee continued laying the groundwork to claim voter fraud following the election.

""We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania. Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW!"" Trump said on Truth Social. ""Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?""

The state has asked for patience as investigations into thousands of potentially fraudulent voter registration applications filed in Lancaster and possibly other counties continue. Shapiro responded to Trump's claims in a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday.

""Let’s remember, in 2020, Donald Trump attacked our elections over and over,"" Shapiro wrote. ""He's now trying to use the same playbook to stoke chaos, but hear me on this: we will again have a free and fair, safe and secure election — and the will of the people will be respected.""

‘Fingers crossed’: Viktor Orbán wishes Trump good luck for Election Day

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday that he spoke with Trump over the phone and wished him “the best of luck for next Tuesday.”

“Only five days to go. Fingers crossed,” he wrote in the post.

Orbán is a hard-right politician who has drawn controversy for his efforts to limit press freedom and political opposition. Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Orbán, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Xi Jinping of China at campaign rallies.

Harris has previously knocked Trump for openly admiring these leaders and cast the former president as a threat to democracy.

Trump and Harris in dead heat in crucial swing state

Trump and Harris are neck and neck in Michigan, a key swing state, less than a week out from the Nov. 5 election, according to a new Washington Post poll released Thursday.

The poll found that 47% of likely voters would back Harris while 46% would back Trump. Among registered voters, 47% said they would back Trump while 45% said they would back Harris.

Six percent of voters in both groups said they had no opinion or skipped answering who they would vote for.

The poll, conducted between Oct. 24 and Oct. 28 among 1,003 registered and likely voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.

Trump vows to ""protect women,"" Harris responds to the comment

Trump told a crowd in Wisconsin Wednesday he would protect women – “whether the women like it or not.”

Campaign advisers to the former president had urged him to not to say that, he said.

“I want to protect the people, I want to protect of our country. I want to protect the women. 'Sir, please don’t say that.’ Why? They said, ‘We think it’s very inappropriate,’” Trump said.

“Well, I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them,” he added. “I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles.”

The Harris campaign jumped on the statement, releasing an ad hours later using clips of Trump’s comment side-by-side with headlines related to reproductive rights.

Democrats have criticized Trump for appointing conservative Supreme Court judges that helped overturned Roe v. Wade. In turn, Trump has boasted about his role in upending a constitutional abortion right and returning limit decisions to the states.

Americans are anxious and frustrated about the 2024 campaigns

Most Americans reported feeling anxious or frustrated about the presidential election in a new poll by The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research released Thursday.

Democrats and Republicans are similarly frustrated by the campaigns, but more Democrats reported feeling anxious about the race. The poll found 79% of Democrats said they were anxious compared to 66% of Republicans.

A majority of Americans are not excited about the presidential contest. Only 24% of independents, 37% of Democrats, and 41% of Republicans said they feel excited about the election.

The survey of 1,233 Americans had a +/- 3.6 percentage point margin of error.

NFL owners' political donations surge to $28 million, lean Republican

NFL owners have donated at least $28 million to federal political candidates and causes during the 2023-24 election cycle − a hefty sum that, according to USA TODAY Sports research, marks a sevenfold increase from the amount spent over the same time period four years ago.

The significant increase in owners' political giving can be attributed in large part − though not exclusively − to the addition of the Walton-Penner ownership group, which purchased the Denver Broncos in 2022.

Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($3.3 million), Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper ($2.9 million) and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson ($1.8 million) are among the other NFL leaders who have eclipsed seven figures in donations.

In response to a request for comment, NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy wrote in an email that ""it is up to club personnel to determine to which candidates and causes they will contribute.""

Harris campaign seeks to shore up support from Puerto Rican, Latino voters

The Harris campaign released a new ad Thursday aimed at targeting Puerto Rican and Latino voters in key battleground states just a few days out from the Nov. 5 election.

The new Spanish-language ad, titled Somos Más, takes a direct hit at comments that comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made at Trump’s Madison Square Rally on Sunday, where he called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”

“Puerto Rico is an island of scientists, poets, educators, stars and heroes. ¡Boricua! We're not trash, we're more,” the narrator in the ad says.

A press release from the campaign notes that the ad will air on Spanish language TV, including Univision, Telemundo and WAPA America, as well as social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube to reach voters.

How ballot counting will be protected on election night and beyond

More than a dozen county and city election officials spoke with USA TODAY about what they are doing to make sure they can count ballots at central ballot counting locations once polls close, no matter what happens outside.

Election officials have built new warehouses where ballots will be counted under increased security. Local and state law enforcement have run through multiple scenarios for large crowds descending on the ballot counting locations.

Some jurisdictions have reduced the number of observers allowed to attend and required them to obtain credentials far in advance.

Who is ahead in the polls?

In the final days of the election, battleground states like Pennsylvania remain tightly-contested for Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump and could represent the key to an Electoral College victory.

Two recent polls show just how close the race is in Pennsylvania, which is among seven swing states that could determine a victory in the race for the White House. A new CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that in Pennsylvania, the race is tied, while a new poll from Quinnipiac University gave Trump a 1-point edge on Harris.

Nationwide, Trump and Harris are tied at 48% in the latest TIPP Tracking Poll.

As the nail-biter of a race approaches its conclusion in five days, Trump and Harris plan to both address supporters Thursday in Nevada, another key swing state.

Harris campaigns in Wisconsin Wednesday night

Vice President Kamala Harris went back to a familiar place in the final stretch of her presidential campaign.

As she runs on preserving personal freedoms and protecting democracy, she made her pitch on Wednesday evening a few miles from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where her progressive parents participated in various civil rights causes in the late 60s. She spoke at the nearly 10,000-seat Alliant Energy Center here, to a majority-female crowd.

As president, Harris pledged that she would seek common ground and common-sense solutions to problems.“I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress,"" she said in her speech.

21,ukraine north russia korean troops said russian ukrainian korea drones,"South Korea, US say 3,000 North Korean troops are entering combat imminently, but experts are unsure that will fundamentally change the course of the war.

Ukraine prepared to fight North Korean troops in the Russian region of Kursk on Wednesday, as the entry of a second nuclear power in Russia’s war against Ukraine threatened to escalate and broaden the conflict.

The United States Pentagon confirmed on Tuesday that North Korean troops were in Kursk, where Ukraine launched a counter-invasion almost three months ago.

Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said there was “a small number [of North Korean troops] in the Kursk oblast, with a couple of thousand more that are almost there or due to arrive imminently”.

A senior South Korean official told reporters on Wednesday that about 3,000 North Korean troops were being moved close to the front lines.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte confirmed the deployment on Monday. “Today I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia and that North Korean army units are deployed to the Kursk region,” he told reporters.

He called it “a significant escalation in the [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s] ongoing involvement in Russia’s illegal war”, and “a dangerous expansion of Russia’s war”.

Ryder confirmed that North Korea had sent a total of 10,000 troops for training in eastern Russia. South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence last week suggested the number could be as high as 12,000.

The extent to which these troops could help Russia’s war effort is unclear because Russian personnel requirements are enormous.

Ukrainian ground forces commander Oleksandr Pavlyuk said via Telegram on Sunday that an estimated 10,520 Russians were dead or wounded in the preceding week.

In Kursk alone, Russia had suffered 17,800 casualties over the past three months, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskii said on Telegram, including 6,600 killed.

North Korea could not make an appreciable difference, said researcher Olena Guseinova in a new study for the Friedrich Naumann Foundation last week.

“The regime, in perspective, could potentially provide Russia with an additional 3 to 4 units, comprising 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers of various skills,” she concluded. “Even in such a case, however, North Korean assistance is unlikely to change the overall course of the war.”

The reasons, she said, were political and military. “The deployment of a large number of soldiers poses challenges in controlling their movements on the ground, heightening the possibility of desertion or defection,” Guseinova wrote, requiring “security personnel to closely monitor the troops”.

She also said, “North Korea cannot afford to deplete its valuable human resources, particularly given that its primary adversary, South Korea, has a population twice its size.”

Caution from allies on both sides

US messaging on the terms of Ukrainian engagement with North Korean forces was fuzzy, as officials appeared to come to grips with the implications of Washington openly encouraging engagement of a nuclear adversary through proxies.

Asked on Tuesday if he supported Ukraine attacking the North Koreans, US President Joe Biden said: “If they cross into Ukraine, yes.”

Asked if Ukraine was at liberty to use US weapons against North Korean troops, Ryder said: “We’ve been very clear that Ukraine is able to employ those capabilities to defend their sovereign territory from threats that are either emanating from across the border or from inside Ukrainian territory.”

On Wednesday, South Korea appeared to pull back from previous suggestions it might assist Ukraine militarily, in retaliation for the North’s assistance of Russia.

South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said Seoul would not send 155mm shells to Ukraine, citing sources in the office of President Yoon Suk-yeol.

A week earlier, an unnamed South Korean presidential official was quoted by Reuters telling reporters: “We would consider supplying weapons for defensive purposes as part of the step-by-step scenarios, and if it seems they are going too far, we might also consider offensive use.”

South Korea will send an intelligence delegation to monitor the military effectiveness of North Korean troops.

There was caution among Russia’s friends, as well.

Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted a BRICS summit in Kazan last week, in an attempt to show that Russia has support in the world.

The Kazan Declaration, however, signed by China, India, Brazil and others, emphasised a peaceful resolution to the conflict, “consistently with the Purposes and Principles of the UN Charter”.

Article 2 of the Charter calls on nations to “settle their international disputes by peaceful means” and “refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state”.

Russia’s only ally in Europe, Belarus, appeared to deny that it might follow in North Korea’s footsteps.

“It would be a step towards the escalation of the conflict if the armed forces of any country, even Belarus, were on the contact line,” Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told the BBC’s Steve Rosenberg.

“Even if we got involved in the war this would be a path to escalation. Why? Because you, the Anglo-Saxons, would immediately say that another country had got involved on one side… so NATO troops would be deployed to Ukraine.”

Russia’s incremental gains continue

Russia continued to make small territorial gains within Ukraine itself during the past week, as it has throughout this year.

On Sunday, Russian troops captured the settlement of Selidovo in the eastern Donetsk region, by advancing from several directions at once.

In an apparent tactical innovation, Russian forces also mounted light, first-person view (FPV) drones with ammunition onto heavy reconnaissance drones, enabling them to travel deeper behind Ukrainian lines.

“The zone of its damage was expanded due to the depth of penetration of the main reconnaissance UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], which… dropped the FPV drone directly in the area of ​​impact with the targets,” National Guard spokesman Vitaly Mylovydov told a telethon.

Despite its constant, small territorial gains, Russia has not achieved anything like the tempo of its initial invasion, said military experts.

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, assessed that Russian gains in September averaged 14 square kilometres (5.4sq miles) a day, slightly more than 1 percent of the 1,265sq kilometres (488sq miles) Russian troops seized per day in March 2022.

“Rapid Russian advances deep into Ukrainian territory, including the temporary seizure of large portions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts characterised the first month of the Russian full-scale invasion,” said the ISW, “whereas more recent Russian advances have been characterised by small-scale, localised, tactical advances”.

Ukraine developing its defence industrial base

Vexed by its allies’ lack of readiness or resolve to send the weapons it needs, Ukraine has fostered the development of its own defence industry during the past year.

Attending the fourth Ukraine-Nordic countries summit on Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy encouraged more investment in Ukraine’s and Europe’s defence industrial base.

“Please continue to develop your own industries, producing everything needed for defence, including sensitive items like microchips. Europe needs industrial strength and independence from other parts of the world,” Zelenskyy said.

He appeared to refer to the US restriction on the use of its weapons to within a short range of the Ukrainian border, which also affects European-made weapons with US components. Ukraine has sought to use long-range US weapons to strike Russian airfields.

Ukraine’s industrial policy has yielded impressive results. Its Ministry of Defence revealed on Tuesday that in the first 10 months of the year, it had issued contracts for the supply of 1.6 million drones of various types, nearly 1.3 million of which had been delivered.

Ukraine has substituted drones for 155mm shells, where Russia has a roughly 2:1 advantage, and used them with devastating precision against Russian drones, dugouts and armour.

Ukraine’s armed forces said drone pilots were practising destroying Russian-made Gerbera drones as training to take out Iranian-designed Shahed drones.

On Friday, Zelenskyy told his national security council, “The biggest priority is drones, of course; including drones that can shoot down Shaheds and other attack drones.”

On Sunday, German defence contractor Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger told Ukrainian news outlet TSN that the company has finished building the first of four plants in Ukraine and will start producing Lynx armoured fighting vehicles for the Ukrainian armed forces by the end of the year.

A bird flu virus has jumped one species closer to a human outbreak.

The H5N1 bird flu was detected in a pig in Oregon, the first instance of a swine infection in the US, officials announced on Wednesday.

Pigs get both bird flu viruses and human flu viruses, making them a genetic mixing bowl where H5N1 could gain genetic mutations that help it spread between humans.

That's not inevitable, but ""I would say the concern elevated slightly with this pig infection,"" Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virus expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the deputy director of a World Health Organization center on animal and bird influenza, told Business Insider.

Experts' fear is that the situation could escalate.

""If we see pig-to-pig transmission in a sustained way this will be very concerning,"" Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, told BI in an email.

The 'animal pandemic' that could jump to humans

This strain of bird flu has killed tens of millions of birds worldwide since 2020 and more than 40,000 sea lions and seals in South America. World Health Organization chief scientist Jeremy Farrar has called this an ""animal pandemic.""

Earlier this year, it made an unexpected jump into US cattle herds.

Since then, H5N1 has even infected a few humans who work closely with livestock in the US. But there has been no sign of sustained human-to-human transmission. Pigs could change that.

Meet the first infected pig

The US Department of Agriculture reported that the infected pig was living in a ""backyard farming operation"" which is now quarantined.

Related stories

Two other pigs on the farm have tested negative for H5N1, while results are still pending for two others. Poultry there have also tested positive.

""There is no concern about the safety of the nation's pork supply as a result of this finding,"" the USDA reported, saying that the pigs at this farm were not intended for commercial food supplies.

Because of the backyard setting, this case doesn't pose the same major outbreak risk as an infection in a commercial pig farm.

""If it starts to spread from pigs to pigs, then it's much more of a problem,"" Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine in New York, told STAT News. ""If it ends up in large pig populations in the US similar to cows, I think this would be a disaster.""

Why pig infection could be a tipping point

Pigs play host to both bird flu viruses and human flu viruses. That makes them a dangerous playground for the two to swap genes.

Inside a pig, the H5N1 bird flu virus could pick up genetic mutations that help it adapt to better infect human bodies.

The more pigs are infected, the greater this risk is. However, Schultz-Cherry said, ""we would not need to see pig-to-pig transmission to worry about this mixing vessel or this mixing bowl effect.""

There's no other animal ""at the top of the list"" with pigs, Richard Webby, a virologist at St. Jude and director of the WHO animal and bird flu center, told BI in June.

That could just be due to gaps in our understanding of animal influenza. After all, he added, ""a few months ago, I would have told you that cows don't get flu.""

Bad timing: Flu season is in full swing

The timing of this development is ""not ideal,"" Schultz-Cherry said, because it's the middle of flu season, and pigs can get the strains of flu that circulate among humans.

Advertisement

If this season's flu strains were to overlap with a pig H5N1 infection, that would increase the risk of gene-swapping that helps the bird flu adapt to humans.

""Really it would just take one pig,"" Schultz-Cherry said.

Getting your seasonal flu vaccine can help, though, especially if you're in contact with cows, pigs, or poultry. Schultz-Cherry said that's because vaccination reduces the amount of flu circulating through the population.

Genomic detective work

Schultz-Cherry was surprised by the pig news but, she said, ""I guess I shouldn't be.""

The virus is circulating in cattle, chickens, wild birds, and cats all over the country. Mice have tested positive.

Just sharing a drinking water source with these animals could put a pig at risk. The USDA reported that livestock and poultry on the Oregon farm shared water sources, shelter, and other equipment.

Now that officials have samples of the virus that infected the pig, they can sequence its genome. That could hint at which animal it first came from.

Scientists will likely look for mutations in the virus that could help it infect humans more easily, such as a tweak that makes it attach to more mammal-type receptors in a host animal's cells.

23,risk covid cardiovascular heart said experiencing adverse events infection attack,"COVID-19 always has a way to come back and bite you.

For instance, new research from the Cleveland Clinic suggests that catching COVID could double the risk of experiencing adverse cardiovascular events in the future, including heart attacks, strokes or even death.

This is concerning since Covid is the fourth leading cause of death in the nation as of 2022, which is the most recent year data is available.

This is shocking news since the thought of contracting COVID these days hasn’t seemed as big of a deal as it did back in 2020.

Despite what many might think, catching COVID isn’t the same as catching the flu, and that’s because its impact could be long-lasting.

“One of the unique features of COVID is that in some people, there unfortunately appear to be long-term adverse effects that can occur following resolution of the acute infection. These studies add to the growing body of data showing that COVID-19 infection can enhance risk for experiencing adverse cardiac events — heart attack, stroke and death — over time,” Dr. Stanley Hazen, MD, PhD, co-senior author of the study and chair of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences at Cleveland Clinic, said to Parade.

Since the COVID-19 virus has only been around since 2019, data surrounding its long-term effects aren’t entirely known yet. However, according to Dr. Hazen, the data shows that even three years after getting COVID, there’s a heightened risk for a heart attack or a stroke.

“This was seen in all subjects independent of age, sex, risk factors for cardiac disease,” he said to the outlet.

So why does COVID greatly increase the risk of heart attack and stroke? For Dr. Hazen, blood type plays a huge role.

According to Dr. Gerhard Albrecht, MD, medical director of cardiology at Bayer, blood types A, B and AB (blood types other than O), are more at risk for experiencing adverse cardiovascular events after contracting COVID.

“This connection may involve genetic factors that influence how the body responds to the virus and its aftermath, particularly in relation to thrombotic events [when a blood clot forms in an artery or vein] and cardiovascular health,” he said to Parade.

Some key ways to better protect yourself include getting vaccinated and boosted. “The more severe the COVID-19 infection, the higher the risk for post-COVID-19 heightened cardiac risks,” Dr. Hazen said.

According to Cardiologist Dr. Danielle Belardo, MD, studies have shown that those who’ve received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine experienced a reduced risk of stroke and heart attack in the months after an infection.

“Vaccination appears to mitigate some of the cardiovascular risks associated with COVID, although further research is needed to fully understand the long-term benefits,” Belardo said to Parade.

Another way is to maintain heart-healthy habits, which means maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly and adopting habits that reduce stress. According to both Dr. Hazen and Dr. Albrecht, people who are in poor heart health are more impacted by COVID, and the more serious an infection is, the higher the risk of experiencing adverse cardiovascular effects in the future.

“Research indicates that those hospitalized for severe COVID face nearly four times the risk of major cardiovascular events compared to individuals without a COVID history. This heightened risk persists for up to three years post-infection, suggesting a strong link between the severity of the illness and long-term cardiovascular health,” Dr. Albrecht said to Parade.

Lastly, stay up to date with your check-ups.

Along with a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle, regular cardiovascular check-ups and discussions with healthcare providers regarding preventative measures, such as medications or lifestyle changes, are another way to lower your risk of heart attack and stroke.

If you’re in good shape, stay on top of your annual check-ins with your doctor. But if cardiovascular disease, heart attacks or strokes run in your family or you’re at a higher risk of experiencing them, plan a visit to your cardiologist annually to manage your risk.",658,"covid, double, contracting, disease, covid19, research, shows, attack, dr, experiencing, hazen, events, cardiovascular, heart, risk",2024-10-31
24,births said reproductive birth 1998 multiple triplet report assisted health,"CNN —

Giving birth to triplets, quadruplets or even more has become increasingly less common in the United States.

The rate of triplet and higher-order births in the US declined 62% between 1998 and 2023, according to a report published Thursday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And the largest declines in rates were seen among mothers 30 and older.

This decline appears to be associated with how guidance has strengthened around the number of embryos transferred during the use of assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization, known as IVF, wrote the researchers, from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics.

Couples are more likely to have twins, triplets or more babies in a single pregnancy when using assisted reproductive technology because these fertility treatments may involve transferring multiple embryos into the uterus in hopes of resulting in a pregnancy.

More embryos not only increase the likelihood of a viable pregnancy, they raise the risk that the pregnancy could involve more than one fetus – hence, twins, triplets or more.

“Monitoring trends in triplet and higher order multiple births is important because women with a triplet/+ pregnancy are at higher risk of complications during pregnancy and their infants are at greater risk of preterm birth and infant death,” Joyce Martin, a researcher at National Center for Health Statistics and the main author of the report, said in an email.

As fertility treatments became more mainstream after the 1980s, there was a rise in the incidence of multiple births, said Dr. Micah Hill, president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, who was not involved in the new report.

In the early 2000s, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology started to issue guidelines on how many embryos should be transferred under different scenarios. The guidelines were issued to help reduce the risk of complications for women undergoing fertility treatments, including the risk of preterm birth.

While the new data does not indicate how many multiple births have been conceived spontaneously versus through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like IVF, the overall decline does appear to parallel the introduction of the guidelines.

Guidelines were released in 2004, Hill said, and updated in 2006, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2017 and 2021.

“If you look at the CDC’s numbers, you can sort of see these declines follow every year or two after these guidance updates have happened,” Hill said.

“These guidelines have evolved as the technology has evolved,” he said. “I think it’s been successful in making fertility treatments safer, which is really what we care about when we’re talking about reducing these higher-order multiples.”

In part, recommendations in the latest guidelines, published in 2021, range from recommending the transfer of only a single embryo at a time for patients younger than 35 to recommending no more than four untested early-stage embryos for patients older than 40.

It’s not just guidance around embryo transfers that has changed in the past decades, possibly leading to declines in triplets and higher-order births.

There also have been shifts in the use of fetal reduction during fertility treatments, a procedure to reduce the number of fetuses when a pregnancy with triplets or more occurs, said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim chief medical officer for the maternal and infant health nonprofit March of Dimes, who was not involved in the NCHS data.

Separately, she called the new NCHS report, showing a decline in triplets and higher-order multiple births, “fantastic news” for maternal and infant health.

“When you have three or more babies inside, you are at a markedly increased risk for preterm birth, for low birth weight, for infant mortality, for NICU stays, and then on the maternal side, increased risk for gestational diabetes, increased risk for gestational hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia,” she said. “So this is good news for families, because triplets and higher order pregnancies are so much riskier for mom and baby.”

A growing ‘public health concern’

In previous years, the rate of triplet and higher-order multiple births in the United States rose from 37 out of every 100,000 births in 1980 to an all-time high of about 194 births per 100,000 in 1998, according to the new report.

This “unprecedented rise” was tied to women giving birth at older ages and “the increased use of fertility treatments,” Martin and her co-author Michelle Osterman wrote in the report.

“The increase was of public health concern because of the greater risk of adverse maternal and infant health outcomes of triplet and higher-order births compared with twins and singletons,” they wrote.

But since 1998, the rate of triplet and higher-order multiple births in the United States dropped to around 74 out of every 100,000 births last year, the new data showed.

Between 1998 and 2009, rates declined but not significantly, falling 21% to around 154 per 100,000 births in 2009. It was from 2009 to 2023 when rates dropped significantly, by 52%, according to the new report, which is based on birth certificate data from the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System. Many people might remember 2009 as the year when Nadya Suleman, known in the media as Octomom, delivered eight babies in a single birth after undergoing IVF.

The new data also showed that the raw number of triplet and higher-order multiple births in the United States declined 65% between 1998 and 2023 – falling from a total of 7,625 births in 1998 to 6,340 births in 2009 to, more sharply, 2,653 births last year.

The new data “are reflective of what we have seen in fertility care” on the ground, said Dr. Asima Ahmad, an endocrinologist and fertility expert who serves as chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a company that helps employers set up fertility benefits.

“Embryology labs have advanced over the years, which allows them to grow the embryos out further than they used to be able to years ago. There is also additional testing available that can give more information about the health of the embryo,” Ahmad, who was not involved in the new NCHS report, said in an email. “Given these advances, it’s becoming more common for a physician to transfer one embryo at a time to achieve the goal of a singleton pregnancy – the healthiest option for the pregnant person and the baby.”

When looking at the data by maternal age, the researchers found that from 1998 to last year, triplet and higher-order multiple birth rates declined 16% for mothers ages 20 to 24; 57% for mothers ages 25 to 29; 77% for mothers ages 30 to 34 and ages 35 to 39; and 67% for mothers 40 and older.

The researchers also found significant racial disparities.

Among White mothers, the triplet and higher-order multiple birth rate fell 71% from 1998 to last year. Triplet and higher-order births for Hispanic mothers fell 25% from 1998 to 2023.

However, the triplet and higher-order birth rate for Black mothers followed a different trend, climbing 21% from 1998 to 2009 and then not changing significantly from 2009 to 2023, resulting in an overall increase of 25% from 1998 to last year.

“The biggest drops were with White women over 30, and that is the group that would have the highest access to in vitro fertilization and actual transfer of embryos, where one could be making the decision to transfer fewer embryos,” March of Dimes’ Williams said.

But there are many other types of assisted reproductive technology, which could be factors driving these racial disparities, she said.

“When you think about Black women or you think about low-income women, they may not have access to the highest level of technology and IVF for their assisted reproductive technology,” Williams said.

“They may be using less technologically advanced means of assisted reproductive technology – such as clomiphene with insemination, where you’re going to be stimulating the ovaries to produce more eggs, therefore driving your numbers of twins and triplets,” she said. “So we can’t conflate assisted reproductive technology with IVF. There are less invasive, less technologically advanced forms of assisted reproductive technology that may be the ones that are being used by Black mothers and low-income mothers.”

Overall, the new data was “very informative,” Dr. Rachel McConnell, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, who was not involved in the report, said in an email.

She added that the report’s findings indicate that the guidelines set by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine to transfer a low number of embryos “has helped to reduce the number of multiple pregnancies” in IVF cycles.",1458,"higherorder, 1998, fertility, births, assisted, triplets, triplet, heres, common, united, birth, technology, multiple, reproductive, states",2024-10-31
25,tubs hot private cruise legionella ship disease according balcony cdc,"They got more than they paid extra for.

A dozen cruise ship passengers were sickened by Legionnaires’ disease — including 10 who were hospitalized — on two different ships, and health experts believe a private luxury amenity is the source, according to a new report.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracked the serious pneumonia-like sickness back to private balcony hot tubs offered on the higher-end cabins inside the two vessels, according to the study published last week.

The vacationers were sickened on the two different boats — from unidentified cruise lines — between November 2022 and this past July.

After months of testing, the private hot tubs — which are not required to undergo as frequent and stringent cleaning and maintenance as their public counterparts — were found to be the source of the nasty outbreaks, the CDC said in its report.

Eight passengers on one cruise ship contracted Legionnaires’ disease while four were infected on the other boat. Some of the travelers became ill on the same voyage while others got sick on the same ship but during a different trip.

The hot tubs apparently created the perfect environment for the Legionella bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease for several months without detection.

On the first ship, the private balcony hot tubs “were found to be operating for months in a manner conducive to Legionella growth, which included maintaining a water temperature in the Legionella growth range (77°F–113°F) for multiple days without draining and operating with no residual disinfectant,” the CDC said.

Six of the 10 private balcony hot tubs on the first ship were positive for Legionella bacteria, and all eight private balcony hot tubs on the second ship were positive for Legionella bacteria, according to testing results.

All the hot tubs were closed and thoroughly cleaned. Both cruise ships have since implemented more preventative measures including only filling the tubs upon guest request, draining them between uses, more frequent cleaning and disinfecting and the removal of heating elements.

Hot tubs — on cruise ships or elsewhere — are often perfect breeding grounds for Legionella bacteria.

But cruises are also known to be drivers of outbreaks of different viruses and diseases due to the tight proximity of guests in a closed-off environment.

26,aging flies fruit accumulation brain buildup lifespan brains autophagy cellular,"Preventing F-actin buildup in aging fruit flies by altering specific genes enhanced cellular recycling, reduced waste accumulation, and extended their healthy lifespan by about 30%.

Humans aren’t the only ones who become more forgetful with age—fruit flies experience it as well. With a lifespan of just around two months, fruit flies serve as a valuable model for studying the cognitive decline associated with aging.

A new study published in Nature Communications shows that when a common cell structural protein called filamentous actin, or F-actin, builds up in the brain, it inhibits a key process that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components within cells, including DNA, lipids, proteins, and organelles. The resulting accumulation of waste diminishes neuronal functions and contributes to cognitive decline. By tweaking a few specific genes in aging fruit flies’ neurons, the researchers prevented F-actin buildup, maintained cellular recycling, and extended the healthy lifespan of fruit flies by approximately 30%.

Actin, a family of proteins that help give cells their shape, are abundant throughout the body. F-actin forms filaments that are essential for maintaining cell structure and many other functions. The researchers, led by former postdoctoral scholar Edward (Ted) Schmid in David Walker’s lab, noticed F-actin buildup in the brains of aging fruit flies and wondered if it contributed to brain aging and overall loss of organismal health.

Their first clue of a correlation: Flies on a restricted diet both lived longer and had less F-actin buildup in their brains. Their second clue: When treated with a drug known to extend lifespan, called rapamycin, there was also less F-actin in the brains of aged flies.

Investigating Causality through Genetic Modification

“But that’s correlation, not a direct demonstration that F-actin is detrimental to aging of the brain,” said Walker, senior author and UCLA professor of integrative biology and physiology. “To get at causality, we turned to genetics.”

Because the fruit fly genome is thoroughly mapped and understood, the group was able to target in aging fruit fly genes that are known to play important roles in the accumulation of actin filaments. That included a gene called Fhos, a member of a family of proteins known to elongate and organize actin filaments.

“When we reduced Fhos expression in aging neurons, it prevented the accumulation of F-actin in the brain,” said Schmid, now an investigator at the Arkansas Biosciences Institute and assistant professor at Arkansas State University. “This really allowed us to expand our study because now, we had a direct way to target F-actin accumulation in the brain and study how it affects the aging process.”

Even though the genetic intervention was targeted to just neurons, it improved the flies’ overall health. They lived 25-30% longer, while showing signs of improved brain function as well as markers of improved health in other organ systems. Preventing F-actin accumulation protects cognitive function, which shows the buildup is driving age-onset cognitive decline.

“Flies get more forgetful as they age, and their ability to learn and remember declines in middle age, just like it does in people,” Walker said. “If we prevent accumulation of F-actin, it helps the flies learn and remember when older — which tells us the buildup is not benign.”

F-Actin’s Interference with Cellular Autophagy

Further investigation showed the F-actin was interfering with the body’s “cellular garbage disposal system.” Damaged or superfluous proteins and other components inside a cell are broken down in a process called “autophagy.” Aging research has established that autophagy pathways become less active with age, but no one knew exactly why.

The new study shows that preventing F-actin accumulation led to much more active autophagy in the brains of aged fruit flies. The authors found that if they removed F-actin but also disabled autophagy, it did not slow aging: The primary mechanism by which F-actin drives brain aging appears to be by impairing autophagy. The researchers also showed that disrupting F-actin in aged brains can restore brain autophagy to youthful levels and reverse certain cellular markers of brain aging.

These findings may be good news for the elderly fruit flies with reduced F-actin in their brains. But it has not yet been demonstrated in humans, and developing interventions to prevent F-actin accumulation might prove more challenging. Still, the discovery directs researchers in a fruitful new direction for healthier aging in people.

“Most of us in the aging field are focused on moving beyond lifespan into what we call the healthspan,” said Walker. “We want to help people enjoy good health and a high quality of life while extending the lifespan. Our study improved cognitive and gut function, activity level, and overall healthspan of fruit flies — and offers hope for what we might be able to achieve in humans.”

27,poultry dairy according cattle department county bird flu utah food,"Estimated read time: 2-3 minutes

LOGAN — Eight commercial dairy operations in Cache County have tested positive for bird flu, according to officials with the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

The announcement comes a week after mandatory testing was put into place for all dairies in the county, where officials began taking weekly tank samples. ""Initial samples from all Cache County dairies were sent to the Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Logan,"" a press release sent out Wednesday says.

The eight positive dairies have been placed under quarantine, meaning no cattle are permitted to move on or off the facility grounds — except if going directly to slaughter, according to the release.

The bird flu was first detected in March at a Texas dairy, though it had been ""circulating in poultry and wild birds in the United States since 2022,"" according to the ag department website. The disease has spread to 14 states since, according to Caroline Hargraves, a spokeswoman for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

A commercial poultry flock in Cache County tested positive for avian bird flu earlier this month, forcing the culling of an estimated 1,852,900 chickens, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food's poultry flock outbreak online dashboard.

Data on cattle herd detections have not been updated on the website.

State veterinarian Daniel Christensen said they ""don't anticipate any major impacts on the food supply and the overall impacts to individual dairies are relatively minimal. This disease is not as harmful to dairy cattle as it is to poultry.""

The bird flu, which is fatal to poultry, is ""often transmitted by wild birds to domestic poultry,"" according to Hargraves.

The department is encouraging dairy and poultry owners to watch herds and flocks for signs of the disease, which include decreased milk production, thicker milk, decreased consumption, dehydration and fever in dairy cattle. ""Most dairy cattle recover within a few weeks,"" he said. Not all dairy cattle will show symptoms, however.

In poultry, symptoms include ""high death loss among flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption and lack of coordination,"" Hargraves says.

29,diet mediterranean diabetes study researchers fish eating risk fruit also,"There is no doubt that following the Mediterranean diet eating pattern has numerous health benefits. It’s been associated with lower inflammation in the body and reduced cancer and heart disease risk. It’s also been shown to support a healthy pregnancy by reducing the risk of preeclampsia, a condition where a pregnant person’s blood pressure rises to potentially dangerous levels (among other things). Following the Mediterranean diet might even save you money on your groceries (and who couldn’t use that!).

A new study published on October 23, in Nutrition Journal, suggests there’s another benefit to following the Mediterranean diet. Let’s see what they found.

How Was This Study Conducted & What Did It Show?

Most studies on the Mediterranean diet have been conducted in Mediterranean countries. These researchers wanted to see if this eating pattern benefited people in non-Mediterranean regions. Specifically, researchers wanted to see if people who lived in China who followed a Mediterranean diet eating pattern had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.

For this study, researchers drew data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The CHNS is an ongoing national study in China that began in 1989, with follow-ups every two to four years. For this study, researchers chose 12,575 participants to be a part of the data set. Participants had an average age of 43, and just over half of them were female.

All participants completed dietary intake questionnaires for three consecutive days—two weekdays and one weekend day (because sometimes we eat differently on the weekend). Researchers then used a Mediterranean diet adherence (MDA) scale to score participants’ diets. The foods that were assessed and scored included vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, cereals, fish, dairy products, meat and alcohol.

Demographic information was collected that included things like age, BMI, physical activity, smoking status, socioeconomic status, education level, occupation and the region of China they lived in. Researchers were also looking for how many participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during the study period.

After several statistical analyses were run, including adjustment for the collected demographic information, researchers found an inverse relationship between the Mediterranean diet and diabetes. In other words, those with a higher Mediterranean diet score were less likely to get diabetes by 17%.

Since foods were scored separately, researchers were able to further refine which ones had the greatest impact. In this case, they found higher fruit, fish and nut intake was significantly associated with a lower risk of new-onset diabetes.

How Does This Apply to Real Life?

Diabetes has been on the rise worldwide for years and it isn’t expected to slow down. As of 2021, over half a billion people worldwide are living with type 2 diabetes—that’s 10.5% of the current population around the globe. In the U.S. alone, about 38.4 million people are living with diabetes—about 11.6% of the total population.

And diabetes is costly. Diabetes-related health expenditures currently average around $966 billion worldwide and are projected to top $1 trillion by 2045.

So it’s clear that something has got to change—and it could start with what we’re eating.

But changing eating habits is not necessarily an easy thing. Many factors come into play, including budget, accessibility and food preferences. And if you’re feeding a family, all those factors are magnified.

There are some small ways to begin to change what you’re eating, though. While many focus on what they can’t eat, pivot your mindset to focus on what you can. And instead of thinking about taking food away, think more about “adding” and “replacing.”

For example, this study suggested that fruit, fish and nuts had the greatest impact on diabetes risk. Are you including any of these foods in your diet now? If not, start with one of them and begin to add a serving a day into your meals or snacks. The easier you make it, the more quickly it will become a habit for you. Let’s take nuts as an example. You could add nuts to your morning oatmeal, toss some into your rice bowl or pair them with dark chocolate. Oh, and nut butter—like peanut butter and almond butter—counts too. The same goes for fruit. Berries in your cereal, mandarin oranges or pineapple in your rice bowl, or banana with dark chocolate. Yes, please!



Fish doesn’t have to be boring either. Pick a new fish or seafood recipe to try each week. Try Grilled Fish Tacos for Taco Tuesday next week. Toss scallops or shrimp with your favorite pasta and pesto. Or make a nostalgic tuna noodle casserole.

Buying frozen or canned fruit and fish can also save you money—and it’s just as healthy as fresh (sometimes more so). Just beware of added sugars in canned fruit—try to get it in 100% fruit juice instead of in syrup made with added sugar.

Of course, you don’t want to live on just fruit, nuts and fish. It’s important to eat a varied diet that also includes other forms of lean protein—like poultry and lean cuts of pork and beef— vegetables, whole grains and legumes, so that you get a wide variety of nutrients. Getting in some servings of dairy can also provide essential nutrients, like protein and calcium.



The Bottom Line

This study suggests that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of diabetes in people from non-Mediterranean regions. Assess what foods from the Mediterranean diet you could be eating more of and begin adding them to your meals and snacks. Other habits that influence diabetes risk include physical activity, sleep and stress. But don’t get more stressed out trying to work on all these habits at once. Start with one or two, assess where you’re currently at with them and gradually begin to improve in those areas. Over time, small steps become big changes and reap many benefits.",963,"according, eating, diabetes, researchers, type, participants, 17, diet, lower, fruit, study, mediterranean, fish, risk",Unknown
30,light said sad people winter therapy depression also desan seasonal,"(AP) – As winter approaches and daylight hours grow shorter, people prone to seasonal depression can feel it in their bodies and brains.

“It’s a feeling of panic, fear, anxiety and dread all in one,” said Germaine Pataki, 63, of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

She’s among the millions of people estimated to have seasonal affective disorder, or SAD. Her coping strategies include yoga, walking and an antidepressant medication. She’s also part of a Facebook group for people with SAD.

“I try to focus on helping others through it,” Pataki said. “This gives me purpose.”

People with SAD typically have episodes of depression that begin in the fall and ease in the spring or summer. Changing the clocks back to standard time, which happens this weekend, can be a trigger for SAD. A milder form, subsyndromal SAD, is recognized by medical experts, and there’s also a summer variety of seasonal depression, though less is known about it.

In 1984, a team led by Dr. Norman Rosenthal, then a researcher at the National Institutes of Health, first described SAD and coined the term. “I believe that because it is easy to remember, the acronym has stuck,” he said.

What causes seasonal affective disorder?

Scientists are learning how specialized cells in our eyes turn the blue wavelength part of the light spectrum into neural signals affecting mood and alertness.

Sunlight is loaded with the blue light, so when the cells absorb it, our brains’ alertness centers are activated and we feel more wakeful and possibly even happier.

Researcher Kathryn Roecklein at the University of Pittsburgh tested people with and without SAD to see how their eyes reacted to blue light. As a group, people with SAD were less sensitive to blue light than others, especially during winter months. That suggests a cause for wintertime depression.

“In the winter, when the light levels drop, that combined with a lower sensitivity, might be too low for healthy functioning, leading to depression,” Roecklein said.

Miriam Cherry, 50, of Larchmont, New York, said she spent the summer planning how she would deal with her winter depression. “It’s like clockwork,” Cherry said. “The sunlight is low. The day ends at 4:45, and suddenly my mood is horrible.”

Does light therapy help?

Many people with SAD respond to light therapy, said Dr. Paul Desan of Yale University’s Winter Depression Research Clinic.

“The first thing to try is light,” Desan said. “When we get patients on exposure to bright light for a half an hour or so every morning, the majority of patients get dramatically better. We don’t even need medications.”

The therapy involves devices that emit light about 20 times brighter than regular indoor light.

Research supports using a light that’s about 10,000 lux, a measure of brightness. You need to use it for 30 minutes every morning, according to the research. Desan said this can help not only people with SAD but also those with less-severe winter blahs.

Special lights run from $70 to $400. Some products marketed for SAD are too dim to do much good, Desan said.

Yale has tested products and offers a list of recommendations, and the nonprofit Center for Environmental Therapeutics has a consumer guide to selecting a light.

If your doctor diagnosed you with SAD, check with your insurance company to see if the cost of a light might be covered, Desan suggested.

What about talk therapy or medication?

Antidepressant medications are a first-line treatment for SAD, along with light therapy. Doctors also recommend keeping a regular sleep schedule and walking outside, even on cloudy days.

Light therapy’s benefits can fade when people stop using it. One type of talk therapy — cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT — has been shown in studies to have more durable effects, University of Vermont researcher Kelly Rohan said.

CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and modify unhelpful thoughts.

“A very common thought that people have is ‘I hate winter,'” Rohan said. “Reframe that into something as simple is ‘I prefer summer to winter,'” she suggested. “It’s a factual statement, but it has a neutral effect on mood.”

Working with a therapist can help people take small steps toward having fun again, Rohan said. Try planning undemanding but enjoyable activities to break out of hibernation mode, which “could be as simple as meeting a friend for coffee,” Rohan said.

What else might work?

People with SAD have half the year to create coping strategies, and some have found hacks that work for them — though there may be scant scientific support.

Elizabeth Wescott, 69, of Folsom, California, believes contrast showers help her. It’s a water therapy borrowed from sports medicine that involves alternating hot and cold water while taking a shower. She also uses a light box and takes an antidepressant.

“I’m always looking for new tools,” Wescott said.

Cherry in New York is devoting a corner of her garden to the earliest blooming flowers: snowdrops, winter aconite and hellebores. These bloom as early as February.

“That’s going to be a sign to me that this isn’t going to last forever,” Cherry said. “It will get better, and spring is on its way.”",857,"real, rohan, seasonal, blue, winter, desan, depression, summer, light, fight, ways, therapy, sad",2024-10-30
31,dinosaur tail amber specimen found bird dinosaurs scientists new light,"Scientists have discovered a dinosaur tail preserved in amber which sheds new light on what the creatures were like.

A specimen was found by a team of scientists in 2016 in Kachin State, Myanmar. Inside the amber is a feathery tail, and according to National Geographic , it’s believed to be about 99 million years old.

Scientists know that the tail belonged to a dinosaur and not an average bird because it is flexible. Researchers from China and Canada believe the tail came from a young coelurosaur, which is a group that includes dinosaur species similar to birds with two legs, per Current Biology .

The fascinating specimen also includes bones, soft tissue as well as feathers. It’s the size of a dried apricot and solidifies the evolutionary difference between the feathers on birds of flight and dinosaurs.

The research, which was led by palaeontologist Lida Xing from the China University of Geosciences, ruled out the possibility that the tail belonged to a prehistoric bird because of the specimen’s vertebrae.

Xing found the specimen at an amber market, and it was originally intended to be a piece of jewellery or just an interesting looking souvenir. The traders at the market thought a plant was trapped inside the 6.5 gram amber, rather than a piece of a prehistoric animal that could have fit in the palm of your hand.

“I realised that the content was a vertebrate, probably theropod, rather than any plant,” Xing shared with CNN .

“I was not sure that [the trader] really understood how important this specimen was, but he did not raise the price.”

The findings shed new light on how dinosaurs looked. Fragments of bird wings from the dinosaur era have been found preserved in amber before, but this was the very first time a dinosaur skeleton had been found, CNN reported.

The research’s co-author and palaeontologist at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada, Ryan McKellar, shared: ""It’s a once in a lifetime find. The finest details are visible and in three dimensions.

""The more we see these feathered dinosaurs and how widespread the feathers are, things like a scaly velociraptor seem less and less likely and they’ve become a lot more bird like in the overall view.

""They’re not quite the Godzilla-style scaly monsters we once thought.""

32,rover perseverance mars nasa crater tubes rock jezero first samples,"NASA’s Perseverance rover is making a treacherous ascent up Jezero Crater’s western wall, navigating slippery slopes and testing new driving strategies to enhance traction. With sights set on reaching the crater rim soon, it aims to investigate scientifically significant sites like “Witch Hazel Hill.”

NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover is making its way up a steep route along the western wall of Jezero Crater, aiming to reach the crater rim by early December. During this challenging climb, the rover captured a sweeping view of Jezero Crater’s interior, along with images of the wheel tracks it left behind after experiencing some slippage on the rocky terrain.

This panoramic view, stitched together from 44 images taken on September 27—the 1,282nd Martian day of Perseverance’s mission—highlights key landmarks from the rover’s 3½-year journey across Jezero. Visible in the mosaic are memorable sites, including its landing spot, the location where it first encountered sedimentary rocks, Mars’ first sample depot, and the final airfield for NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. The rover took this remarkable shot near a location the team has nicknamed “Faraway Rock,” about halfway up the crater wall.

“The image not only shows our past and present, but also shows the biggest challenge to getting where we want to be in the future,” said Perseverance’s deputy project manager, Rick Welch of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “If you look at the right side of the mosaic, you begin to get an idea what we’re dealing with. Mars didn’t want to make it easy for anyone to get to the top of this ridge.”

Visible on the right side of the mosaic is a slope of about 20 degrees. While Perseverance has climbed 20-degree inclines before (both NASA’s Curiosity and Opportunity rovers had crested hills at least 10 degrees steeper), this is the first time it’s traveled that steep a grade on such a slippery surface.



This animated orbital-map view shows the route NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has taken since its February 2021 landing at Jezero Crater to July 2024, when it took its “Cheyava Falls” sample. As of October 2024, the rover has driven over 30 kilometers (18.65 miles), and has collected 24 samples of rock and regolith as well as one air sample. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech

Strategy Adjustments in Rover Navigation

During much of the climb, the rover has been driving over loosely packed dust and sand with a thin, brittle crust. On several days, Perseverance covered only about 50% of the distance it would have on a less slippery surface, and on one occasion, it covered just 20% of the planned route.

“Mars rovers have driven over steeper terrain, and they’ve driven over more slippery terrain, but this is the first time one had to handle both — and on this scale,” said JPL’s Camden Miller, who was a rover planner, or “driver,” for Curiosity and now serves the same role on the Perseverance mission. “For every two steps forward Perseverance takes, we were taking at least one step back. The rover planners saw this was trending toward a long, hard slog, so we got together to think up some options.”

On October 3, they sent commands for Perseverance to test strategies to reduce slippage. First, they had it drive backward up the slope (testing on Earth has shown that under certain conditions the rover’s “rocker-bogie” suspension system maintains better traction during backward driving). Then they tried cross-slope driving (switchbacking) and driving closer to the northern edge of “Summerland Trail,” the name the mission has given to the rover’s route up the crater rim.

Data from those efforts showed that while all three approaches enhanced traction, sticking close to the slope’s northern edge proved the most beneficial. The rover planners believe the presence of larger rocks closer to the surface made the difference.

“That’s the plan right now, but we may have to change things up the road,” said Miller. “No Mars rover mission has tried to climb up a mountain this big this fast. The science team wants to get to the top of the crater rim as soon as possible because of the scientific opportunities up there. It’s up to us rover planners to figure out a way to get them there.”

Anticipation of Scientific Discoveries

In a few weeks, Perseverance is expected to crest the crater rim at a location the science team calls “Lookout Hill.” From there, it will drive about another quarter-mile (450 meters) to “Witch Hazel Hill.” Orbital data shows that Witch Hazel Hill contains light-toned, layered bedrock. The team is looking forward to comparing this new site to “Bright Angel,” the area where Perseverance recently discovered and sampled the “Cheyava Falls” rock.

The rover landed on Mars carrying 43 tubes for collecting samples from the Martian surface. So far, Perseverance has sealed and cached 24 samples of rock and regolith (broken rock and dust), plus one atmospheric sample and three witness tubes. Early in the mission’s development, NASA set the requirement for the rover to be capable of caching at least 31 samples of rock, regolith, and witness tubes over the course of Perseverance’s mission at Jezero. The project added 12 tubes, bringing the total to 43. The extras were included in anticipation of the challenging conditions found at Mars that could result in some tubes not functioning as designed.

NASA decided to retire two of the spare empty tubes because accessing them would pose a risk to the rover’s small internal robotic sample-handling arm needed for the task: A wire harness connected to the arm could catch on a fastener on the rover’s frame when reaching for the two empty sample tubes.

With those spares now retired, Perseverance currently has 11 empty tubes for sampling rock and two empty witness tubes.

More About Perseverance

NASA’s Perseverance rover, launched as part of the Mars 2020 mission, plays a crucial role in the search for ancient microbial life on Mars. A primary goal of Perseverance is astrobiology: collecting and storing rock and soil samples that may contain traces of ancient life. Beyond its search for biosignatures, the rover studies Mars’ geology and past climate, providing valuable insights to support future human exploration of the Red Planet.

As the first mission to gather and cache Martian samples, Perseverance paves the way for NASA’s Mars Sample Return Program, a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), which aims to bring these samples back to Earth for detailed analysis.

33,infinite time monkey monkeys theorem finite works well universe number,"If you sit sufficient monkeys in front of sufficient typewriters and give them sufficient time, eventually their random banging will reproduce the works of Shakespeare.

Thus asserts the Infinite Monkey Theorem, a thought experiment that considers the possibility that a cumulation of random events will eventually produce something of great meaning. Nobody really expects a bunch of small furry primates to come out with poetry that will sing to the soul… and that, according to new research, is probably just as well.

Mathematicians Stephen Woodcock and Jay Falletta of the University of Technology Sydney in Australia have crunched the numbers, and determined that there won't be enough time in the entire estimated lifespan of the Universe for monkeys to accidentally hammer out a sequence of key-presses that matches Hamlet.

""The Infinite Monkey Theorem only considers the infinite limit, with either an infinite number of monkeys or an infinite time period of monkey labor,"" Woodcock explains. ""We decided to look at the probability of a given string of letters being typed by a finite number of monkeys within a finite time period consistent with estimates for the lifespan of our Universe.""

Experiments have been conducted to test the validity of the theorem, but somewhat less well known is the Finite Monkey Theorem, where the number of monkeys and the amount of time are limited. This is more consistent with what we might experience in the real world, where both monkeys and time are expected to eventually run out.

The calculations were based on different numbers of 'monkeys' between 1 and 200,000 – the estimated current global population of chimpanzees – in front of keyboards with varying numbers of keys, typing at one keystroke per second for a googol years – an estimated time until the Universe undergoes heat death, which would effective put a stop to any simian tapping.

By altering these variables, they were able to perform calculations on how long it would take to produce various works within various timeframes. And, well, the results aren't promising for fans of The Bard.

A single chimpanzee typing on a 30-key keyboard has a 5 percent chance of coming out with the word ""bananas"" within its own lifetime.

The reproduction of the entire 884,647-word works of Shakespeare from 200,000 chimps in a googol years? It just ain't happening. The probability is 6.4 x 10-7448254 – it may as well be zero.

In fact, we'd be extremely lucky to just get the entire ~1,800-word text of the children's book Curious George by the end of the Universe. The team's calculations reveal a probability of 6.4 x 10-15043 for that one.

The finding, the researchers say, therefore classifies the theorem as a paradox, alongside others in which the infinite and finite scenarios have directly contradictory results. These include the St. Petersburg paradox, concerning infinite rewards in a game of chance nobody would pay to enter; Zeno's dichotomy paradox, which proposes that an object covering infinite fractions of a distance can never arrive at its destination; and the Ross-Littlewood paradox, which suggests a vase can be filled with an infinite number of balls.

None of these scenarios work in a finite real world; and this, Woodcock and Falletta have demonstrated, is also the case for the Infinite Monkey Theorem.

""It is not plausible that, even with possible improved typing speeds or an increase in chimpanzee populations, these orders of magnitude can be spanned to the point that monkey labor will ever be a viable tool for developing written works of anything beyond the trivial,"" they write in their paper.

""We have to conclude that Shakespeare himself inadvertently provided the answer as to whether monkey labor could meaningfully be a replacement for human endeavor as a source of scholarship or creativity. To quote Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 3, Line 87: 'No'.""

34,viridian propulsion spektor orbit said electric system technology vleo earth,"SAN FRANCISCO – Southern California startup Viridian Space Corp. is developing an electric propulsion system for spacecraft in very low Earth orbit that scoops up air for plasma thrusters.

The technology promises to extend the life of satellites and enable them to move around in orbit, Rostislav Spektor, Viridian CEO and former manager of the Aerospace Corp. electric propulsion laboratory, told SpaceNews.

Research on air-scooping electric propulsion began in the 1960s. Until recently, the idea was often dismissed because no one had succeeded in producing engines with enough thrust to offset the atmospheric drag.

“Everyone who has tried this up to now has failed because they just weren’t able to figure out how to make the system efficient enough,” Spektor said.

Since Viridian was founded in El Segundo, California, in 2021, Spektor and co-founder Matthew Feldman, a former Aerospace Corp. research engineer, have “improved the overall efficiency of our system to the point where prototype hardware tested in a vacuum chamber is working on efficiencies required to make it feasible,” Spektor said. “I believe we’re one of the first companies to demonstrate that.”

VLEO’s Promise

Very low Earth orbit, or VLEO, is attracting attention from startups, established aerospace companies and government agencies. Applications include high-resolution Earth observation, high-bandwidth communications and, for military satellites, the ability to maneuver extensively.

With air-breathing electric propulsion, Spektor said, satellites in VLEO could operate for a decade. “This is based on the components that are going into our propulsion system,” he said, adding that the company is largely relying on commercial-off-the-shelf hardware.

Still, it’s challenging to build a spacecraft to operate for 10 years in VLEO. Metal fatigue is one problem. Another is atomic oxygen.

“There are material-interaction issues, especially with solar panels and other satellite components,” Spektor said. “This is something that we’re actively addressing right now.”

Viridian plans to demonstrate its technology on a satellite in low-Earth orbit within three years. After the initial demonstration, Viridian will incrementally improve the technology to extend the operational lifespan and enhance performance.

Longer-term, the company plans to develop propulsion systems that can ingest and store extra propellant to enable a satellite to raise its orbit for satellite-servicing missions.

The in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing “economy is nascent now, but it’s coming,” Spektor said. The propulsion concept could lead to reusable tugs that could, for example, “grab a piece of space junk and bring it down,” he added.

FUNDING

To date, Viridian has raised about $2.5 million in pre-seed funding. In an upcoming seed round, the startup seeks to raise money to demonstrate its technology in orbit.

The U.S. Air Force and National Science Foundation have awarded Small Business Innovation Research contracts to Viridian.",447,"airbreathing, system, satellites, orbit, vleo, electric, propulsion, develops, technology, viridian, spektor, satellite",2024-10-31
35,ant like kavaliauskas small nikon see images snapped face picture,"You've most likely never seen an ant like this before: in an ultra-closeup, Lithuanian photographer Eugenijus Kavaliauskas snapped a shot of an ant's face that looks like a still from some fantasy epic like The Lord of the Rings.

The picture has been honored as an 'Image of Distinction' in the 2022 Small World Photomicrography Competition run by Nikon, and it's easy to see why. The snap also attracted a lot of attention and plaudits over on Reddit.

The picture is a close-up of the mandibles and antennae of Camponotus – a common carpenter ant. They make their nests inside wood, mostly in forest environments, and snack on parts of dead insects, nectar, and honeydew released by aphids.

There is some clever cropping going on in this image. According to the Washington Post, the parts of the ant's face that look like glowing red eyes are in fact the bases of its antennae, while what appear to be yellow teeth are very small 'trigger' hairs that ants use to sense the surrounding environment.

The photo was actually snapped through a microscope at 5x magnification, with a reflected light technique used to really bring out the details of the visage of the ant.

As Kavaliauskas told the Washington Post, having tried his hand at photographing birds of prey he now focuses his attention on insects. You can see plenty of other fascinating examples of his talent and eye for detail on his Instagram page.

""I'm always looking for details, shadows, and unseen corners,"" Kavaliauskas told Insider.

""The main goal of photography is to be a discoverer. I am fascinated by the Creator's masterpieces and the opportunity to see God's designs.""

Another 56 photos were also labeled as Images of Distinction by the competition judges, and they're all worth taking a look at – we've got macro images of mouse embryos, butterfly scales, dinosaur bones, and lots more.

The overall winner of the contest showed the embryonic hand of a Madagascar giant day gecko (Phelsuma grandis), captured by Grigorii Timin and Michel Milinkovitch from the University of Geneva in Switzerland.

""Each year, Nikon Small World receives an array of microscopic images that exhibit exemplary scientific technique and artistry,"" says Eric Flem, Communications and CRM Manager at Nikon Instruments.

36,musk officials pentagon space spacex spy us government one dod,"And they have good reason to worry.

Tinker Tailor

SpaceX just launched some reportedly ""next-gen"" spy satellites on behalf of the US government — and it sounds like certain officials at the Pentagon are anxious about it.

In interviews with the New York Times, Pentagon officials and consultants who work with the space industry say that there are those within the Department of Defense concerned about the secretive spy crafts, especially in the wake of revelations that Elon Musk has been having cozy phone chats with Vladimir Putin.

Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that these Musk-Putin tête-à-têtes have been going on ""regularly"" since all the way back in 2022. During one such call, Putin asked the multi-hyphenate CEO not to provide Starlink satellite internet to Taiwan as a ""favor"" to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Given that Taiwan does indeed lack Starlink coverage, it would appear that Musk acquiesced.

NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has publicly voiced concern about the alleged exchanges, and he's not the only one: officials at the DoD have apparently been worried privately that, as critics have long pointed out, the US government may have erred by putting all its eggs in Musk's increasingly conspiratorial and far-right basket.

Monopoly Money

Three Pentagon officials interviewed by the NYT anonymously so they could speak freely said that if nothing else, there's growing apprehension about the appearance of a SpaceX monopoly if both NASA and the DoD are using it near-exclusively for space contracts.

Indeed, in a report issued earlier this year, the Pentagon's Defense Science Board warned that the ""emergence of vendor lock, or dependence upon a sole vendor, has the potential to negate the strengths of the market by stifling innovation and inflating prices.""

""This can culminate in a de facto monopoly,"" the report continued, ""cementing a stagnant and wasteful anticompetitive paradigm.""

Mandy Vaughn, a member of that DOD board and the CEO of the space consultancy GXO, took the criticism a step further.

""There isn’t a launch or a spacecraft competition that SpaceX can’t walk into and completely warp and run the table,"" Vaughn explained to the NYT. ""That’s a problem.""

At the end of the day, it's a massive issue that the person who controls so much of the US government's space contracts has been chatting on the regular with one of our country's biggest rivals — and now, he's in charge of sending out new spy satellites.

37,race report evans transplant used algorithms kidney health cnn clinical,"New York CNN —

Jazmin Evans was diagnosed with kidney disease at the age of 17 in 2012. She received a kidney transplant in July 2023, after being on the transplant wait list for four years. Today, a year and a half after the transplant, Evans says she feels great, and her kidney is working “perfectly fine,” with “no signs of rejection.”

But her journey to a transplant wasn’t easy. Evans told CNN that she was placed on the kidney transplant list in 2019 — four years later than she should have been – because her race was used in clinical equations to assess the health of her kidneys.

“I should have been placed on the transplant list in 2015 because there is no scientific reason why my race as an African American should’ve been a factor in how well my kidneys function,” Evans said.

The equation used to assess Evans’ kidneys routinely overestimates the kidney function of Black Americans, delaying Evans’ treatment. The equation’s overreliance on race is inaccurate and dangerous but unfortunately still common, according to a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that was published Wednesday.

The report found that race and ethnicity in biomedical research are used “sometimes in harmful ways.”

Clinical equations are used by health-care professionals to help make decisions in patient care and treatment.

Race and ethnicity are used to categorize Americans often, but according to the report, these categories can be misused in scientific analyses. The report adds that this characterization contributes to the “persistent misconception” that humans can be biologically divided based on their race, an idea known as “race science.”

Race can influence diseases in individuals because it acts as a social determinant of health, not a biological one. The report critiques the overuse of race in algorithms, treating it as a proxy for other variables, such as socioeconomic status or discrimination.

“Race is a very strong predictor for certain diseases,” Dr. M. Roy Wilson, an ophthalmologist who co-authored the report, told CNN. “We just think that it’s overused and relied on too much, without looking at what some of the underlying reasons might be for the disease.”

The report included other examples of how race has been improperly seen as a driver of disease, like sickle cell disease among Black individuals. The high propensity is believed to be due to geographic distribution or ancestry, rather than race.

The use of race as a factor for determining health, and subsequent treatment plans, can come from “outdated assumptions about race” — the same assumptions that affected Evans’ treatment.

“There’s no question that many other clinical algorithms have basis in racist thinking, or in outright racism,” Wilson said. “It’s also no question that some of these clinical algorithms that are race-based have been harmful.”

Some researchers propose that increasing diversity in the fields that create these models can help reduce bias in algorithms. Others also propose “cross-functional expertise” when creating these algorithms, CNN previously reported.

To combat inaccurate AI assumptions, the report stated, health professionals must use “careful deliberation” before deciding whether to include race in their calculations. Including race in algorithms when it is “appropriate and scientifically justified” will depend on the research and its goals.

Wilson said that this assessment and justification should be done “throughout the different stages of the research process.”

The report also recommended that researchers partner with “relevant communities” to include authentic and expansive experiences of race and ethnic groups.

Evans, who was not involved with the new report, is now an advocate for racial equity in health care. She says there needs to be a re-analysis of “general assumptions about patients because of their race,” adding that health-care providers need to understand that there is a “layer of racism that is baked into” some of the tools used in determining patient care.

“Our understanding of race and ethnicity is continuing to evolve,” Wilson said. “And that’s why this study was so important at this time.”",664,"harmful, evans, kidney, transplant, research, health, cnn, report, assumptions, used, race, medical, ethnicity, algorithms",2024-10-30

39,comet sun close approach nasa soho perihelion discovered encounter s1,"A newly discovered comet met its demise during a dangerously close encounter with the Sun, breaking apart into chunks and destroying any hope of being spotted for Halloween.

NASA and the European Space Agency’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spotted Comet C/2024 S1 (ATLAS) as it made its closest approach to the Sun on Monday. The affectionately nicknamed Halloween Comet’s last moments were captured by SOHO as it raced towards the star and violently disintegrated into smaller fragments.

Wheeeeee! ☄️ ESA/NASA’s Sun-watching SOHO spacecraft spied comet C/2024 S1 ATLAS (entering from bottom right) as it darted toward the Sun. The comet reached its perihelion, or closest approach of the Sun, today at 7:30am ET. pic.twitter.com/T7kvthWOPe — NASA Sun & Space (@NASASun) October 28, 2024

“This comet was likely already a rubble pile by the time it entered SOHO’s field of view,” Karl Battams, principal investigator for the LASCO instrument suite on SOHO and lead for NASA’s Sungrazer Project, is quoted as saying on X.

It’s disappointing news for sky watchers who had hoped to see the comet streak across the skies this week, just in time for the spooky holiday. However, the comet’s gruesome death does live up to its nickname.

The Hawaii-based ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) survey first spotted the comet on September 27, and it quickly gained notoriety for its potential to put on a spectacular show in the night skies. Astronomers believed that the comet would be visible to the unaided eye as it approaches perihelion, or its closest distance to the Sun, at 7:30 a.m. ET on October 28.

During its closest approach to the Sun, Comet C/2024 S1 came as close as 1% of the distance between Earth and the Sun. Unfortunately, the comet did not survive its encounter with the star, failing to show off its bright tail to us Earthlings. In fact, it was already doomed before it got there. “Over the past few days, it has broken into chunks as it approached the Sun,” NASA wrote on X.

On the other hand, Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinan-Atlas), a comet originating from the Oort Cloud that was discovered by China’s Tsuchinshan Observatory in January 2023, survived its own perihelion on September 27, and was visible in the skies to the unaided eye. This comet, however, only came about a third of the distance between Earth and the Sun, according to NASA.

Comet C/2024 S1 belongs to a group of comets known as Kreutz sungrazers, named for their characteristic close approach to the Sun at perihelion. Astronomer Heinrich Kreutz was the first to notice that the group of comets share similar orbits, coming within a very close distance to the Sun. The Kreutz sungrazers likely all came from a big comet that broke apart years ago, and they all tend to be on the smaller side. That’s why during their close approach to the Sun, the sungrazers either completely disintegrate or crash into the star. Some lucky comets, however, do survive the close encounter.

Most famously, Comet Lovejoy, discovered in 2011, survived its perihelion and emitted a unique blue and green glow that lit up the night skies. Unfortunately, that didn’t last for very long as the comet’s nucleus disintegrated just a few days after its encounter with the Sun. In 1965, comet Ikeya-Seki was discovered by two amateur astronomers from Japan. The comet also survived its rendezvous with the Sun, and reached a brightness magnitude of -11, or nearly as bright as a half-Moon, and became visible to the unaided eye.

If it had survived its close approach to the Sun, the Halloween Comet would have reached a brightness magnitude of -7. That’s brighter than Venus, the brightest planet in the solar system, which has a magnitude of -4.6. We missed out on a good show, but the comet will still go down in history as a spooky legend.",647,"sungrazing, noshow, s1, dust, survived, soho, skies, close, approach, halloween, perihelion, distance, comet, comets, turns, dramatic, cosmic",2024-10-30
40,yankees inning cole first said series dodgers season judge game,"Aaron Boone reacts to the costly errors in the fifth inning that led to the Yankees losing their lead to the Dodgers. (1:47)

Open Extended Reactions

NEW YORK -- All year, right through the American League Championship Series, the New York Yankees overcame a tendency to play sloppy baseball by vanquishing opponents with overwhelming talent. The metrics calculated -- and the eyes figured -- that they were the worst baserunning team in the majors during the regular season. They regularly committed head-scratching defensive miscues. They were not nearly as fundamentally sound as one would expect from a 94-win AL champion.

But the Yankees flaunted superstars. They had Aaron Judge and Juan Soto fueling an offense that banged home runs. They had Gerrit Cole fronting a top-line starting rotation. They discovered an effective bullpen formula in time for October. Ultimately, they out-talented teams -- until they couldn't.

Their shortcomings finally caught up with them in Game 5 of the World Series on Wednesday night. A total defensive meltdown in the fifth inning, one that will be remembered as one of the worst in postseason history, cost the Yankees their season in a 7-6 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers at Yankee Stadium, ultimately ending their bid to become the first team to overcome a 3-0 series deficit in the World Series.

""This is like as bad as it gets,"" said Cole, the Yankees' Game 5 starter.

Cole was on the mound for the fifth-inning debacle. The right-hander, pitching on four days' rest for the fourth time this season, cruised up to the disaster, holding Los Angeles scoreless over four hitless innings. Cole threw just 49 pitches. The Dodgers' only baserunner reached on a walk. Trouble did not appear imminent. Then everything fell apart.

It started with Enrique Hernández breaking the modest no-hit bid with a leadoff single. Four pitches later, Tommy Edman hit a routine line drive to Judge in center field. An inning earlier, sure-handed Judge had made a highlight catch crashing into the wall to steal extra bases from Freddie Freeman. This time, he flubbed the liner for his first error in 2024 -- regular season or postseason.

""That doesn't happen, we got a different story tonight,"" Judge said.

Five pitches after that, Will Smith hit a ground ball to shortstop Anthony Volpe's right side. Volpe, a Gold Glove winner last season and a finalist this year, fielded the ball cleanly but short-hopped his throw to third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. attempting to nab the lead runner. Chisholm failed to corral the throw, loading the bases with no outs. Yankee Stadium went silent.

Then Cole went to work. He struck out Gavin Lux on four pitches, finishing him off with a 99.4 mph fastball. Up next: Shohei Ohtani. Cole needed four pitches to strike out the superstar, too, getting Ohtani to wave through a curveball at the bottom of the strike zone.

Suddenly, an escape without any damage seemed possible. It seemed like a certainty when Mookie Betts hit a 49.8 mph squibber to first baseman Anthony Rizzo. Because the ball bounced to Rizzo with so much spin, he did not charge it, instead staying back to make sure he gloved it cleanly. That meant he needed Cole to cover first base to beat Betts to the bag. But Cole didn't dash to first base to cover the bag, and Betts reached base without a throw.

""I took a bad angle to the ball,"" Cole said. ""I wasn't sure really off the bat how hard he hit it. I took a direct angle to it, as if to cut it off because I just didn't know how hard he hit it. By the time the ball got by me, I was not in position to cover first. Neither of us were, based on the spin of the baseball and him having to secure it. Just a bad read off the bat.""

The Dodgers scored their first run on the gaffe, which went down in the box score as an infield single. It will be memorialized as the beginning of the end of the Yankees' season. Freeman, the third straight past MVP whom Cole was tasked to retire, slashed a two-run single to center field. Teoscar Hernandez followed with a game-tying two-run double to left-center field, completing a stupefying sequence that left the crowd stunned.

""You can't give teams like that extra outs,"" said Judge, who clubbed his first career World Series home run in the first inning to give New York a quick 2-0 lead. ""They're going to capitalize, especially [with] their 1-2-3 top of the order. They don't miss.""

Cole needed 38 pitches to survive the inning. He kept the score tied and rebounded to pitch into the seventh inning. He exited the game with one out and with a one-run lead -- Giancarlo Stanton's sacrifice fly in the sixth inning put the Yankees back on top -- but the fifth inning changed the game.

""We didn't take care of the ball well enough in that inning,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""Against a great team like that, they took advantage.""

With little margin for error, Tommy Kahnle entered to pitch the eighth inning. He surrendered a leadoff single through the left side to Hernández and lost his command from there. Edman reached on an infield single. Smith was walked on four pitches. Boone decided that was enough and replaced Kahnle with closer Luke Weaver.

""I let my team down,"" said Kahnle, his eyes red from emotion.

The Yankees' best reliever in October, Weaver yielded a sacrifice fly to Lux that tied the score again and brought up Ohtani with runners on the corners. Weaver got ahead with the first pitch, getting Ohtani to foul off a changeup. But Austin Wells was called for catcher's interference on the swing, which loaded the bases for Betts. He delivered another sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers their first lead. It was the only lead they needed.

In the end, the Yankees committed nearly every kind of defensive miscue possible. There was Judge's inexplicable physical mishap, Volpe's throwing error, Cole's mental blunder, Wells' interference and, finally, a balk from Weaver in the ninth inning. The balk didn't impact the scoreboard, but it typified the Yankees' flaws on a night when they were exposed for the world to see.

""Capitalizing on mistakes, probably, and opportunities,"" Stanton said when asked what he believed was the difference in the series.

It certainly was the difference in the two games that bookended the series. In Game 1, Gleyber Torres' inability to corral a throw from the outfield on Ohtani's double in the eighth inning allowed Ohtani to advance to third base. Ohtani then scored on a sacrifice to tie the score. The run ultimately forced the game into extra innings, where Freeman, with the Dodgers down one, swatted a walk-off grand slam.

The gut-punch loss marked the beginning of the Yankees' 3-0 hole. They had a chance Wednesday to continue digging themselves out of it. But the fifth inning changed everything. After the game, after Alex Verdugo swung through a curveball from Walker Buehler to end their season, the Yankees didn't open the clubhouse to the media for 45 minutes, such an unusually long time that Boone began his news conference by apologizing for the delay.

The manager explained players were ""pouring their hearts out"" with ""heartfelt messages."" He emphasized, as the team has all October, this club's closeness. He said the defeat ""is going to sting forever."" In the clubhouse, players said their goodbyes with backslaps and hugs.

""I think falling short in the World Series will stick with me until I die, probably,"" Judge said.

In the end, the Yankees' talent was more than enough to win the AL East and claim the league's No. 1 seed. It won out against the Kansas City Royals and Cleveland Guardians, clubs with a sliver of the Yankees' $300 million payroll, in October. But the Dodgers, another high-priced roster brimming with star power and future Hall of Famers, were too good for that to happen again. They were the better, more fundamentally sound baseball team.

42,james lebron bronny cavs said nba game lakers first moment,"CLEVELAND — Akron native LeBron James posed for photographs, gave hugs and exchanged handshakes with dozens of people, a collection of family, friends and fans, Wednesday night on his way out of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.

James had just experienced a dual homecoming and added a new chapter to his legacy by appearing in the same NBA game as his eldest son, Bronny, in their old stomping grounds.

For the Los Angeles Lakers' father-son duo, the icing on the cake was Bronny James also scored for the first time in an NBA regular-season game, albeit late during a 134-110 loss to the unbeaten Cavaliers.

""To see him get his first NBA basket in this arena where he grew up not too far away from here, it's an unbelievable moment, an unbelievable moment for him, first of all, for our family,"" LeBron James said. ""It's just pretty cool to be a part of it.""

Bronny James scored his first regular-season points as an NBA player when he made a 14-foot jump shot with 2:03 left in the fourth quarter.

""It was just a dream come true for me,"" he said.

LeBron James scored 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and added six rebounds and three assists in 29 minutes. He is dealing with an illness, but it didn't sideline him on a memorable night.

In an unexpected twist, the Jameses did not play at the same time against the Cavs, who won their only championship in franchise history with LeBron James leading the way in 2016.

LeBron and Bronny James became the league's first father-son tandem to play together on Oct. 22, when the Lakers (3-2) opened the 2024-25 regular season at home against the Minnesota Timberwolves.

“It's a beautiful story,” Cavs coach Kenny Atkinson said. “[With] two kids of my own, I can't even imagine, right? I enjoy playing in the backyard with my son — to do it on an NBA court? Beautiful story. I love it. I think we should celebrate it.”

Cleveland celebrated it by creating what Atkinson described as an electric atmosphere.

With 5:16 left in the fourth quarter and the Lakers trailing 119-98, Bronny James checked into the game for the first time, but his dad was done playing for the night. The son came off the bench after fans chanted ""we want Bronny"" with about eight and a half minutes left to play and the Cavs (5-0) ahead by 23 points. The chants boomed on two other occasions with 7:06 and 6:29 remaining. He received loud cheers when he entered the game and again when he made his basket.

""It was insane, much more than I anticipated, for sure, but it's all love,"" said Bronny James, who finished with two points on 1-of-2 shooting from the field, two assists and a steal in five minutes. ""It was insane. It was a nice moment. The chants really got me. I was straight-faced, but I felt it, and it felt really good, especially coming from here. Yeah, it was a special moment for me, for sure.""

More on Cavs vs. Lakers:Score updates and highlights as LeBron James, LA visit Cleveland

LeBron James is accustomed to receiving a hero's welcome when he reunites with the Cavs, but the most recent one proved to be different. The Cavaliers played a tribute video and shouted out LeBron and Bronny James together. With the Cavs ahead 20-15, the presentation displayed on the scoreboards with 6:55 left in the first quarter elicited a standing ovation from the Cleveland crowd.

""It was a pretty cool moment,"" LeBron James said. ""I didn't really get an opportunity to kind of seize the moment because we was getting our [butts kicked] at that moment. So I was a little angry. I was a little angry at that point in time during that timeout. So I didn't get an opportunity to really, like, appreciate it. But I heard it. And then when they said his name, too, that's when I kind of looked up. And I believe I tapped him on the leg, I believe. That's just pretty cool, though.""

Adding to the hometown flavor, Bronny James toted a drink and bag of food from Swensons after the game. The famous drive-in business with Akron roots is one of his father's favorites.

The Cavs drafted LeBron James No. 1 overall out of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in 2003. The next year, the oldest of LeBron and Savannah James' three children, Bronny, was born at Cuyahoga Falls General Hospital.

As a kid, Bronny James spent countless days in the downtown arena where his dad used to compete as a member of the Cavs. Bronny James revealed he even played pickup basketball on the arena's top-floor practice court with the children of other players during Cavs games.

The memories came flooding back.

""[We have] a lot of great memories on the court, but a lot of great memories off the floor as well in this community,"" LeBron James said. ""To have the mutual respect and love for what we was able to accomplish in the years that we were here, it's definitely very humbling. And we don't take it for granted every time we get to come back and either play the game that we love, which we did tonight, or just be home and just be in the community.""

LeBron James, 39, is in his 22nd NBA season. The league's all-time leading scorer has played 11 seasons with the Cavs (2003-10 and 2014-18), four with the Miami Heat (2010-14) and is in his seventh with the Lakers (2018-present).

In June, the Lakers drafted Bronny James, 20, in the second round (No. 55 overall) out of the University of Southern California.

Now LeBron James is witnessing his new teammate and son realize an NBA dream.

""It's the greatest thing in the world,"" LeBron James said.

43,ohtani japan japanese said world tokyo newspaper also pride ginza,"Open Extended Reactions

TOKYO -- The World Series trophy is headed to Los Angeles, but there's a hearty celebration going on across the Pacific Ocean in Japan, too.

People milled around the edge of the Ginza shopping area in central Tokyo on Thursday afternoon as single-sheet, special newspaper editions rolled off the presses, proclaiming Japanese stars Shohei Ohtani and Yoshinobu Yamamoto as world champions along with their Dodgers teammates after a stirring Game 5 victory over the New York Yankees.

The headline in Japanese in the Sports Nippon newspaper, set in yellow and blue type with red highlights, read: ""No. 1 in The World. Ohtani beats the Yankees.""

""I want to thank my Japanese fans for coming all the way to cheer me this season,"" Ohtani said on Japanese television. ""That cheering gave me some energy, so I'm glad I could return the gratitude by winning.""

The newspaper handouts are a Tokyo tradition when Japan celebrates a big event. And it was a scramble, as usual, with men and women -- young and old -- sprinting up and down the sidewalk to get their free collector's items.

Yasuko Shibata, an 80-year-old woman who said she faithfully watches Ohtani's games, said she admired ""Ohtani's personality."" Not to mention his great play.

""His presence is huge,"" she said. ""He is a source of my energy. When he doesn't do well, I also feel blue""

Another fan echoed her thoughts, standing near the Ginza underground entrance.

""He is the pride of Japan,"" said Hideki Shinohara, who called himself a hardcore fan. ""You cannot describe him with just 'amazing.' You need to invent a new word.""

Shinohara added: ""He went through many things this year, and I didn't expect him to come all this way. I am very pleased with what he has achieved. ""

The Japanese pride in Ohtani is a huge one for a country whose players were once considered too small, or only good pitchers. Now, there is strong pride in the fact that their players are among the best in the game.

Japan defeated the United States in the World Baseball Classic final last year in Miami, another sign of the country's prowess in the American pastime.

It was also a victory for Ohtani's hometown in northern Japan -- Oshu City -- where fans have been gathering all week and anticipating their superstar would help deliver the title.

About 38,000 special edition newspapers were also published in Iwate Prefecture, the northern area where Oshu City is located.",417,"ohtanis, japanese, celebrates, world, japan, win, yamamoto, tokyo, dodgers, pride, ohtani, victory, series, way, newspaper",Unknown
44,soto yankees game team free 5 agency said every new,"The New York Yankees' year came to a close on Wednesday night with a loss in World Series Game 5 to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Whereas the Dodgers moved on to celebrating and planning their championship parade, the Yankees had to shift their focus to the future. That means, among other things, accepting the possibility that star outfielder Juan Soto will leave the team this winter through free agency.

Soto, who turned 26 last week, will be the top free agent available when the market opens on Monday. Only one player in Major League Baseball history has amassed as many Wins Above Replacement as Soto at this point and reached free agency in their mid-20s: former Yankees infielder Alex Rodriguez. Coincidentally, both Soto and Rodriguez are/were represented by super agent Scott Boras.

Predictably, Soto's looming free agency was a topic of discussion after Game 5 Wednesday.

""You never know. At the end of the day, we'll see where we're at,"" Soto said when asked about the chance of Game 5 being his final contest in pinstripes. ""Definitely a tough game to be my last one. But really happy with what we accomplished as a team and how far we got.""

As for his rumored preference for remaining in New York -- a predilection that, if true, would suggest he'll sign with the Yankees or Mets -- Soto played coy.

""I'm really happy with the city, with the team, how these guys do,"" Soto said. ""At the end of the day, we're gonna look at every situation, every offer that we'll get and take the decision from there.""

Every team, he said, has the ""same opportunity.""

Soto's bidding is expected to exceed $500 million and perhaps get well into the $600 million range.",292,"dont, agency, free, team, game, plans, soto, yankees, million, happy, look, offer, york, rodriguez, really, juan, slugger",Unknown
45,yankees first game cole dodgers world judge inning series ball,"From the first day of spring training to the last, nothing is more common in each camp than pitcher’s fielding practice.

Day after day. The routine. The monotony. And within all the various permutations of these drills, none is more practiced than ground ball to first, pitcher gets over to cover. It is designed to make sure the most basic of plays is executed correctly.

So fittingly, it executed these 2024 Yankees — perhaps the most technically unsound team to ever get this far.

In a slapstick fifth inning in which the Yankees played all their greatest hits — or, more familiarly, errors — they still would have survived had Anthony Rizzo and Gerrit Cole completed a Baseball 101 play. But in the worst World Series blunder at first since perhaps the ball going by Billy Buckner, both made mistakes of omission.

And the Yankee season is over because of it, finalized in a 7-6 World Series Game 5 loss that carried the Dodgers to their eighth title and sent the Yankees to an offseason of regrets.

“You look at what haunted us the whole year and it might have been some plays that could have been made and weren’t made or some situations that we could have gotten out of and we didn’t,” Nestor Cortes said.

The Yankees lost the first game of the World Series and the last game of the 2024 MLB season because they are bad at baseball. In those two games, they handed away outs and 90 extra feet like the kindest Santa in the world. They did not lack talent as much as technique — and that only cost them history.

For there is a stew of willfulness, relentlessness and pride to do the routine in baseball well. The Yanks talked about embracing each other, but they never did quite embrace the need to button up all that was wrong with them. Instead, multiple Yankees talked in a losing clubhouse about “mistakes” that doomed them as if they were not within the team’s control to prevent. Since mid-February. And, really, longer than that.

These Yankees, after all, have been on a rinse, repeat cycle as to how they lose in the postseason during the Aaron Judge Era. Their fundamental maladies are overcome against inferior AL Central opponents, but when the degree of October difficulty rises, the Yankees crumble.

The Yankees were 31-9 (.775) against the AL Central (postseason included) this year and 71-65 (.522) against everyone else. They have played seven rounds against the AL Central in the playoffs since 2017, including two to win the AL pennant this year, and advanced through all seven. They have played eight rounds against everyone else and won only one, the one-game wild card in 2018 vs. the A’s, who kind of spiritually (if not geographically) belong in the AL Central.

They won one World Series game this year — Game 4, when the Dodgers threw none of their main pitchers: The AL Central of strategies. The Yankees were to the Dodgers what the Guardians were to the Bombers in the ALCS — a team tantalizingly close to winning every game, yet eliminated in five against a superior opponent.

“It comes down to what it always comes down to — you have to limit mistakes,” Judge said. “You don’t give your opponent a chance to breathe.”

4 Yankees starting pitcher Gerrit Cole points to first as Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts runs on an infield single allowing a run to score during the fifth inning of Game 5 on Oct. 30, 2024. Charles Wenzelberg / New York Post

The Yankees all but built an oxygen tent to revive the Dodgers as they played to both halves of their 2024 personality in the finale.

They are at their best when they hit homers and Judge plays well — as Judge goes, so often do the Yankees. And Judge hit a two-run homer in the first, Jazz Chisholm followed with a blast and Giancarlo Stanton opened the third with his team-record seventh postseason homer. Judge also made a brilliant defensive play, robbing Freddie Freeman of an RBI double with a backhanded catch just before slamming into the left-center field wall in the fourth.

That allowed Gerrit Cole to preserve a no-hitter and the Yankees to hold a 5-0 lead.

But as Judge goes, so go the Yankees. He dropped a routine fly to center with one on and none out in the fifth. He said there was no reason for what was his first error all year. Anthony Volpe then spiked a ball that Chisholm could not corral at third and the bases were loaded with no out. Cole, though, struck out Gavin Lux and Shohei Ohtani and induced a squibbed grounder to first.

Rizzo said he laid back on it because of the English on the ball, but attacking it would have allowed him to make the play unassisted. Cole said he initially broke as if to try to grab the grounder — which was not really that close to him — and that set him off on a bad pathway to cover first … and he just stopped. Neither made it to the bag. Betts did. An inning-ending groundout instead became an RBI single.

Afterward, Rizzo and Cole would apologize to each other. Boone would say that Cole’s exhaustion from the inning perhaps limited his energy to reach the bag. The routine becoming not routine. The Yankees being the 2024 Yankees.

And still, Cole could have limited it to one run. But World Series MVP Freddie Freeman lashed a two-run single and Yankee killer Teoscar Hernandez a two-run double and it was tied. The volume and energy drained from a crowd of 49,263 that believed the Yankees were about to make history and become the first of 25 teams to go down oh-three in the World Series and force a Game 6.

The Yankees would actually take a 6-5 lead in the sixth, but it was an inning in which they had three walks and no hits. They drew eight walks from the second to eighth innings and that was the lone one that scored. They went 1-for-10 overall with runners in scoring position.

Luke Weaver was on the mound for two sacrifice flies in the eighth that put the Dodgers ahead — of course aided by another Yankee mistake, a catcher’s interference against Austin Wells.

Thus, the story of the 2024 Yankees was finalized — beneficiaries of a favorable draw, talented enough to get to the World Series, but again not technically sound enough to beat a heavyweight opponent.",1229,"world, game, aaron, 2024, shows, judge, wrong, inning, dodgers, debacle, cole, series, judgeera, yankees, fifth",2024-10-31
46,said fan yankees night new fans game team betts torres,"NEW YORK (AP) — Two New York Yankees fans who were ejected from Game 4 of the World Series for interfering with Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts have been banned from Game 5 on Wednesday night.

Betts leaped at the retaining wall in foul territory and caught Gleyber Torres’ pop fly in the first inning Tuesday night, but a fan in the first row with a gray Yankees road jersey grabbed Betts’ glove with both hands and pulled the ball out. Another fan grabbed Betts’ bare hand.

“Not good. There’s no place for that. It’s as simple as that,” New York manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday. “Come here, cheer, root for your team, whatever. No place for that. Should never have hands on anyone.”

The Yankees called the behavior “egregious and unacceptable.” The team said the fans involved are season-ticket holders, and the club gave their Game 5 tickets to Calvin Young, a pediatric cancer patient who lives in New Jersey, and his family.

Young, 15, was unable to attend a kids-only news conference at the ballpark in September to mark Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. The World Series appearance was his first postseason game at Yankee Stadium, according to the team.

“Yankee Stadium is known for its energy and intensity, however the exuberance of supporting one’s team can never cross the line into intentionally putting players at physical risk,” the team said Wednesday in a statement. “The Yankees and Major League Baseball maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward the type of behavior displayed last night. These fans will not be permitted to attend tonight’s game in any capacity.”

The Major League Baseball Players Association also expressed concern about player safety and security.

“As with every incident at the ballpark that affects players, we have been in regular contact with league security officials since last night’s incident and will be closely tracking both the response to that incident and the protective measures taken going forward, beginning tonight,” the union said in a statement.

Los Angeles left fielder Teoscar Hernández said he didn’t think there was anything to worry about Wednesday night.

“I’ve played here for six years against the Yankees, and I never see anything go wrong with the opposite team,” he said.

“Fans know they cannot do that, what that fan did last night,” Hernández added. “It happens, but unfortunately for him, he’s going to be thinking about that play last night for a long time. ... I’ve never seen anything like it, but now that I see pictures and videos and all that stuff, it’s a little crazy.”

Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said he doesn’t think his players worry about their safety at Yankee Stadium, and he believes banning the fans involved was an appropriate measure.

“If there’s one player that I don’t think is worried (it) would be Mookie, given that he played a lot of games in this ballpark (with rival Boston). It was just an unfortunate circumstance. I’m glad it was dealt with the right way, and we can just move on to tonight,” Roberts said. “As I understand it, they got booted. We didn’t need them to be here, so they refunded their tickets. So that’s perfect, right?”

When the play occurred, the Dodgers had an early two-run lead on Freddie Freeman’s two-run homer.

“I saw it. It was maybe one of the more extreme — kind of trying to rip a ball out. But at the same time, that’s kind of New York. I feel like that’s what you expect out here. You expect some unique things,” Yankees left fielder Alex Verdugo said Wednesday.

“At the end of the day, I didn’t feel it was too serious. I think Mookie kind of shook it off, too. That’s just kind of the passion, I guess, New Yorkers have.”

Betts reacted angrily in the moment, but he quickly calmed down when Torres was immediately called out by umpires on fan interference.

“That was wild,” Betts said after the Dodgers won Game 5 to win the World Series. “I’ve never experienced anything like that. I was telling my wife, that was like the second time in my life I ever wanted to fight someone. I get it man. I get it. I don’t know what he was really trying to do. But he had to do what he had to do. And it is what it is.”

Three years ago, Verdugo was playing the outfield for the Red Sox when he was struck in the back by a ball thrown from the left-field seats at Yankee Stadium. He was not hurt.

Boston manager Alex Cora briefly pulled his team off the field that night, and the fan who threw the ball was banned for life from attending big league games.

The following season, fans in the notoriously rowdy right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium pelted Cleveland Guardians outfielders with bottles, cans and other debris in a chaotic scene after New York rallied for a walk-off win.

Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and other Yankees players rushed toward the outfield fence, trying to calm the crowd.

Moments earlier, Guardians outfielder Myles Straw had climbed the chain-link fence in left to confront face-to-face at least one fan, while another fan nearby made a derogatory gesture.

Cleveland players were angry because they said a fan was celebrating an injury to Guardians left fielder Steven Kwan, who had just run hard into the wall chasing a tying double.

Straw called Yankees fans the “worst fan base on the planet” and was greeted the next day with chants of “Crybaby!” by the famed Bleacher Creatures in the Bronx. The Yankees said that day they increased security in the stands.

Torres has had two at-bats impacted by fan interference in this World Series. With two outs in the ninth inning of Game 1 at Dodger Stadium, he hit a fly ball to left field, and a fan reached over the top of the fence and caught the ball. Torres was awarded a double.

Torres hit a three-run homer to right field in the eighth inning Tuesday night.

A previous version of this story corrected that Torres’ homer did not provide the final runs of the night for the Yankees.

47,bioware mcvinnie release dragon age veilguard animation times rpg studio,"Almost ten years after Inquistion offered up a thrilling herb-harvesting adventure, today sees the release of Dragon Age: Veilguard. I’ve popped the release times below. The internet's Aged Dragons are naturally quite excited, and there’s been some lovely interactions over on Le Epic Musk Zone, where veteran Bioheads are celebrating the RPG studio’s history of animation quirks, specifically the ‘Bioware Turn’. Here’s a clip:

And here’s those release times:

Image credit: Bioware

Violet McVinnie, currently of Resistor studio Long Way Home and previously a cinematographer at Bioware on games like Mass Effect 2, has chimed in to speak about the animation.

“Ex Bioware dev here,” wrote McVinnie. “I'm responsible for some of the ""Bioware Turns"". This anim is part of a set called ""Posebreakers"" which are intended to move characters around the area if a scene is feeling too static. We'd combine them with the infamous ""Exit Left/Right"" between cuts.”

People in McVinnie’s replies are also curating a collection of their favourite Bioware-isms, including 'flick of the wrist accusatory point', 'walk away nonchalantly while looking back over the shoulder', ‘worried forehead rub’, and ‘aggressive headshake after drinking alcohol’ (“just from the mocap recording”, says McVinnie).

One player asked why “everyone in Mass Effect break(s) eye contact and look(s) off to the side when handing objects to people?”, to which McVinnie replied “if it’s the hand off anim I think it is, it was baked into the animation file before we started using it. Not sure of the origin. Many animations propagate through lots of Bioware franchises. ME3's Thane/Kai Leng fight cutscene has a lot of Jade Empire combat animations stitched together.” We do love to see a bit of canny asset reuse.

I done wrote Wot I Think about Dragon Age: The Veilguard here. In short: It’s not much of an RPG, and its action wears thin sooner than I’d have liked, but it’s got such heart and enthusiasm it won me right over by the end. Oh, I just remembered comments are temporarily down, too! Sera best companion. Dragon Age 2 wasn’t that great. Anyone moaning about Marvel dialogue in the new game, fair enough, but I must ask if you’ve somehow erased Alistair from your memory. Happy Veilguard day to those who celebrate, and happy Widget Inc day to those who don't.",384,"rpg, turn, players, famous, release, mcvinnie, mass, releases, dragon, wrote, think, bioware, veilguard, today, age, celebrating",2024-10-31

Apple’s marketing chief Greg Joswiak confirmed the news in a post on X. According to him, Apple Vision Pro will be launched in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates on November 15, just a week after the launch of the new M4 Macs.

“Apple Vision Pro is coming to South Korea and the United Arab Emirates on November 15! We’re excited that customers in a dozen countries and regions will get to immerse themselves in the world of spatial computing,” Joswiak announced.

In these countries, Apple Vision Pro pre-orders begin on November 4 at 5 a.m. local time. The Vision Pro webpage has now been made available on both the South Korean and UAE sites ahead of the pre-order.

With the launch in South Korea and UAE, Apple Vision Pro will be available in 12 countries.

With a starting price of $3,500 in the US, Apple Vision Pro has been considered a niche product. In an interview this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the device is not a mass-market product. A report from The Information revealed that Apple has enough inventory to meet the demand for Vision Pro “for the foreseeable future.”

Analysts believe that Apple has enough components to produce up to 600,000 headsets by the end of the year.

49,glover said got new life three lost two biscuit know,"Greg Glover has been a fixture at 94.7 KNRK for nearly 20 years. He hopes sharing his story will encourage others facing challenges similar to those he's endured.

Example video title will go here for this video

Example video title will go here for this video

PORTLAND, Ore. — As the sun rises each morning, droves of groggy Portlanders awaken to a voice they've been tuning in to for nearly two decades. It belongs to Greg Glover, a radio DJ for 94.7 KNRK, an alternative-indie rock station.

""It's Foo Fighters on 94.7 FM!"" exclaimed Glover into the microphone, with more energy than seems possible that early in the morning.

""Greg and Biscuit here, getting you going on your early Tuesday!"" he shouts.

Biscuit is Glover's dog, a tiny Chihuahua mix who's always by his side.

""Listeners know him more than they know me,"" Glover said with a chuckle.

Glover has loved music for as long as he can remember. The 3,000 records in his personal collection are a nod to that fact, and to his mom in Glover's home state of Alabama.

""I was raised on whatever was on the radio and my mom listened to,"" said Glover, flipping through his alphabetized collection of vinyl. ""Gotta have all the Steely Dan, gotta have all The Replacements.""

At around noon, Glover's morning show is done and he heads to Prost!, a local pub on North Mississippi Avenue.

""This is my routine, this is my corner office where I spend a lot of time,"" said Glover, pointing to a table at the bar.

There's a plaque on the table that actually has Glover's name on it.

""I don't know if I'm proud of that or embarrassed by it,"" Glover said with a laugh.

Before he sits down, Glover pops next door to Bloodbuzz for an iced coffee.

""These people see me every day,"" said Glover. ""They even made me this mug!""

The inscription on the mug says, ""Don't act brand new.""

""Words to live by,"" said Glover, tapping the mug. ""Back in Alabama I once saw a mom with her kids at a store. They were pulling things of the shelves, she was just trying to hold it all together and she was like, 'Get over here! Don't you act brand new!!' And I was like, I love that. It's kinda become my motto.""

The barista at Bloodbuzz handed Glover his iced coffee and sent him off.

""Don't act brand new!"" she said.

Coffee in hand, Glover headed back to Prost!, where he sat down with two of his best friends, Skip Werner and Lori Blumenthal.

""Hey Buddy!"" they exclaimed as they began catching up.

Not much has changed over the past 15 years, except for one very significant detail: the drink in Glover's hand. Instead of iced coffee it used to be liquor. A lot of it.

""I'd come in here with my laptop, have a couple drinks — two, three, four drinks,"" said Glover. ""Then I'd go home and have two, three, four drinks. That was just routine. It wasn't 'til later that I realized that that's not normal.""

Blumenthal listened, nodding her head.

""It felt like he had dug himself into a big hole,"" said Blumenthal. ""And he didn't know how to climb out.""

Glover agreed, feeling both reluctant and anxious to share that part of his life.

""You know, I've never been comfortable talking about this,"" he said. ""Three years ago today, I sat here and took my last drink of alcohol ... I quit cold turkey.""

Lost job, lost life, lost way

Glover will be the first to tell you that his path to sobriety was not typical.

Then again, the events that led to Glover's decision were also not typical. Glover lost his dream job and cheated death in the same month. It happened during the fall of 2020, beginning when the company that owns 94.7 did some restructuring.

""I was part of some layoffs,"" shared Glover.

About three weeks after Glover went off the air, he got up to walk Biscuit, but never made it out the door.

""I got really light-headed,"" said Glover.

The last thing he remembered was yelling out for his wife, Alana, for help.

""She came downstairs and I was laying on the floor,"" he said. ""I was on my back, my ice coffee spilled everywhere, Biscuit shivering next to me.""

When paramedics arrived, Glover's heart rate was 13 beats per minute. They rushed him to the hospital. There, Glover said, moments from his life began flashing through his mind quickly, like a Rolodex.

""It was kissing a girl for the first time, or hitting my one and only homerun in high school or seeing U2 for the first time,"" said Glover. ""And then everything went black.""

Doctors performed chest compressions to save Glover's life.

""The next thing I remember is waking up and saying, 'What just happened?' Then the doctor said, 'We lost you. But we got you.'""

Glover went into emergency surgery and doctors put a pacemaker in his heart. Later, they noted something else about his health.

""They said when you came in, your liver levels were a little high, but when you left two days later, they were fine!"" said Glover.

Most people might assume that the near-death experience was what led Glover to stop drinking. But that same week, Glover said he was back in the pub and his drinking only got worse.

""I think I was spiraling,"" he said.

Glover decided to seek help from a therapist.

""I thought maybe I need to talk to someone other than someone at the end of the bar about what was going on with me,"" shared Glover. ""The fact that I just lost my job and I just lost my life and I'm probably drinking a little more than I should.""

But even with therapy, it would take eight more months before Glover got the wakeup call that stuck.

""My wife said something to me, and it embarrassed me,"" said Glover.

""Yeah, it was getting pretty obvious at that point,"" said Glover's wife, Alana. ""I told him, 'I don't want to be married to an alcoholic.'""

Glover listened.

""I didn't want to let her down and I didn't want to continue to let myself down,"" he said.

To be brand new

Glover decided to quit drinking for one week. The day it actually happened caught him by surprise.

""I came into Prost! and I was like okay, I'm going to have a couple drinks, read my New York Times and that was my plan for the day,"" recalled Glover.

But for some reason, Glover's drink hit differently that day.

""I picked it up and took it to the bar and I said to the bartender, 'Patrick, I can't drink this.' And he said, 'I got you.' And he took my drink and I picked up my paper and I walked out the door and that was the longest day of my life.""

Glover got through it. With help from his therapist, he set a new goal: three weeks without drinking. This fall marks three years sober.

""His outlook is completely different than it used to be and it shows,"" said Werner. ""I can see it in him, and I'm really proud of him.""

""To watch him, he's thriving!"" said Blumenthal, hugging Glover. ""I think he has what he needs now in a way he didn't have before. to cope.""

Glover has something else as well. After a year off the air — his first year sober — Glover got his job back. KNRK went through more restructuring, but this time it meant the return of Glover and Biscuit. Station manager Mark Hamilton remembers.

""People delighted that Greg and Biscuit were back on the air on 94.7,"" said Hamilton. ""It doesn't get much better than that. ""

""It was really serendipitous,"" said Glover. ""My life hasn't gotten worse since I left alcohol.""

When Glover returned to the airwaves, listeners had no idea what he'd been through. This fall, he finally opened up on Facebook.

""People said, 'Wow, I'm two weeks sober and this inspires me to keep going!'"" shared Glover. ""Wow. That meant a lot.""

Glover is clear on this point: his journey to sobriety is his alone. He noted others might take a different path. Glover is grateful for the support he has received from his friends — including Dan Hart. who owns Prost!

""We'll always have our coffee dates,"" said Hart. ""It's just great that he still wants to come around, hang out with me and hang out with the rest of his friends. Amazing.""

When Glover reflects on what he's been through, he always feels a little emotional.

""I'm super lucky,"" he said. ""I have some good friends.""

Glover knows not everything is perfect now.

""Life is still going to have curveballs come my way, I know — my anxiety tells me so!"" said Glover. ""But no matter what happens, I'm better equipped to deal with those things when they come up than I was three years ago, that's for sure.""

Asked if that was Glover acting brand new, he paused.

""Yeah,"" he chuckled. ""In some ways I am.""

Maybe acting brand new isn't such a bad thing after all.",1544,"going, brand, life, glover, drink, radio, drinking, glovers, finding, job, im, lucky, survives, know, lost, biscuit, loses, portland, neardeath",2024-10-30
50,chrome memory tabs google inactive saver browser made new open,"The latest stable update to Google Chrome improves its Memory Saver with new controls that could, depending on your workflow and hardware, help reduce the browser’s memory footprint.

And some would say it needs it.

Google Chrome has a rep for being a memory hog. But is it deserved? Once upon a time, perhaps. Yet whenever people do tests they tend to find that Chrome’s RAM usage is less egregious than popular opinion would contend.

Anecdotally, many users still say otherwise.

Expanded memory settings now available in Chrome

Which is perhaps why the latest update to Google’s dominant web browser introduces 3 new options to control the existing Memory Saver feature, all accessible via the Settings > Performance panel once Memory Saver is turned on.

The 3 new modes are:

Moderate – tabs made inactive after extended duration

tabs made inactive after extended duration Balanced – tabs made inactive sooner, based on system needs

tabs made inactive sooner, based on system needs Maximum – tabs made inactive after a shorter period of time

In effect, you can now tell Chrome to free up tabs from inactive tabs sooner than it previously did.

For users on memory-constrained systems it may mean they can open more tabs without needing to close old ones, and run memory-intensive apps outside the browser without having to close it.

What is Google Chrome Memory Saver?

Memory Saver was added to Google Chrome in 2022 as an means to improve the browser’s performance during heavy usage, and potentially extend battery life by using less power (since more memory used means more power consumed).

To do this it “…frees up memory from inactive tabs [to give] active tabs and other apps more computer resources and keeps Chrome fast. Your inactive tabs automatically become active again when you go back to them”.

Memory Saver was already useful, but the new controls make it even better

It’s especially handy if you’re the kind of person who keeps a LOT of tabs open, including memory-heavy ones like, ahem, Gmail, Google Maps,YouTube… ;)

Inactive tabs are marked so you know they’ll reload when you switch back to them, and Chrome lets you add specific sites to a keep-alive list since there may be websites, web apps, and web services you need to stay active in the background.

Curious about how much memory a tab in Google Chrome is using? Open the built-in task manager or, for less effort, enable the Settings > Appearance toggle to list active memory usage in the preview which appears when you hover over a tab.

Getting This Update

These expanded Memory Saver controls are present in the latest Google Chrome stable release. If you have the browser installed (and updated it recently) you can go take advantage – the feature is not enabled by default.

If you don’t have the browser already then installing Google Chrome on Ubuntu is easy: download the DEB from the Chrome website, open it App Center to install, then away you go.

The Google APT repo gets added when you install using the DEB. This means future Chrome browsers updates are installed right alongside your other Ubuntu updates.",526,"inactive, open, web, google, control, memory, usage, offers, chrome, browser, saver, active, tabs, update",2024-10-30
51,black ops 6 call duty microsoft nadella launch game pass,"Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has called last week's Black Ops 6 launch the ""biggest Call of Duty release ever"", saying its arrival set a record for ""Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day.""

News of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's success came amid Microsoft's Q1 FY2025 financial earnings report, which once again saw the company recording notable gains in gaming revenue, up 43 percent year-over-year. That's alongside a 61 percent year-on-year increase for Xbox content and services revenue, although growth was primarily a result of Microsoft's $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. In contrast, the company's Xbox hardware revenue has continued to fall, this time by 29 percent year-on-year.

Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition also helped provide more good news for investors, thanks to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's recent arrival. While opening weekend numbers saw physical sales of Black Ops 6 fall by 10 percent in the UK compared to Modern Warfare 3, likely due to its day one appearance on Game Pass, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella trumpeted the launch in an earnings call today, calling Black Ops 6 the ""biggest Call of Duty release ever"".

While Nadella didn't share specific figures to illustrate his claims, he noted Black Ops 6's launch had set a ""record for day one players as well as Game Pass subscriber adds on launch day."" That Game Pass metric was previously rolled out last year when Nadella announced Bethesda's Starfield had ""set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever"", indicating higher numbers for Black Ops 6. However, it remains to be seen if those numbers prove sufficient for Microsoft, given Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch marks a critical test for its subscription service strategy following its Activision Blizzard acquisition.

Nadella also revealed Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's opening weekend had attracted the highest number of PC players in the franchise's history, while unit sales on PlayStation and Steam were said to be up 60 percent year-over-year. Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch repeated many of Nadella's record-setting claims in a message shared on social media, adding that Black Ops 6 had also seen the highest number of total players, hours played, and total matches played during a three-day opening weekend in Call of Duty's history.

But how has it gone down with the critics? Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell shared his thoughts on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's ""nonsensical, but surprisingly intimate"" campaign earlier this week, calling it a ""return to form for the series, mixing the usual, slightly unsavoury real-world set dressing with cracking action, horror twists and tongue-in-cheek charm."" We'll be reaching a verdict on Black Ops 6's multiplayer component at a later date.",448,"subscriber, nadella, record, game, day, 6s, black, set, launch, duty, sets, pass, microsoft, ops",2024-10-30
52,game cpu see performance cpus red dead redemption amd 7950x3d,"Rockstar has just released Red Dead Redemption Remastered on PC. And, to be honest, I wasn’t planning to cover it. You see, this is a remaster and we don’t usually benchmark them. However, after popular demand, I’ve decided to take a look at it. So, let’s see how this port runs on a high-end PC.

For these benchmarks, we used an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D with 32GB of DDR5 at 6000Mhz, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. We also used Windows 10 64-bit, and the GeForce 566.03 driver. I know there is a new driver for the game. Still, overall performance seemed already great. Moreover, we’ve disabled the second CCD on our 7950X3D.

As you may already know, the game is locked at 144FPS. Thankfully, though, you can use this mod to unlock the framerate. So, we’ve decided to use it so that we can see whether we were CPU bottlenecked. And the results really caught me off guard.

At 4K/Max Settings, our AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D was bottlenecking the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090. In the open-world area, the game was running with 143-151FPS. And, as we can clearly see, GPU usage was around 68%.

Hyper-Threading/SMT does not bring any performance gains, and it may have a negative effect on older CPUs. From what we could see, Red Dead Redemption Remastered mainly uses two CPU cores/threads. This means that you’ll need a CPU with fast IPC and fast memory modules to hit framerates higher than 150FPS. Again, this is for the open-world area. The indoor environments can easily hit 200FPS.

At first glance, getting 143FPS is not a bad thing, right? However, that’s with the fastest CPU available right now. Moreover, Red Dead Redemption looks like a PS3 game. So, you’d expect it to run better. Not only that but I can now see why some users on older CPUs may have trouble running it.

The good news here, at least for those with an RTX40 GPU, is that the game supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation. By using it, you can at least improve the game’s performance. Since we’re talking about a CPU bottleneck, DLSS 3 Super Resolution will not improve your performance. Thus, you can only rely on Frame Generation.

Sadly, RDR does not support AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation. This is a bummer as only those with an RTX40 will be able to somehow overcome the game’s CPU optimization issues. Everyone else will hit a CPU wall, especially when using older CPUs.

The good news here is that you will be able to use Lossless Scaling to enable Frame Generation. And, since the game has native support for NVIDIA Reflex, the input latency should be minimal. There might be some visual glitches but hey, at least there is a workaround for all those that don’t have an RTX40 GPU.

So there you have it. Red Dead Redemption Remastered is CPU-bound on PC, even when using high-end CPUs. Now don’t get me wrong. On a high-end CPU, the game will run fine. It’s not like it’s unplayable. No no no. The game ran great on our AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D. I mean, we’re talking about 140FPS. I also didn’t notice any stutters. This is a great gaming experience. However, those with older CPUs may encounter performance issues. And that sucks.",552,"remastered, dead, cpubound, older, cpus, ryzen, redemption, game, performance, frame, amd, 7950x3d, red, cpu, nvidia, pc",2024-10-30
53,game horror one still survival like alien games much even,"It’s that time of year again. And while watching one of the classics on TV or Blu-ray never gets old, sometimes you want to mix things up for Halloween with video game or two.

There’s obviously no shortage of titles to choose from, but if you’re stuck with what to play this year, we’ve come up with a couple of suggestions of recent releases (and some classics) for you or a group of like-minded folks to get in your seasonal scares.

Obviously, if you feel there’s a grievous omission, feel free to chime in down before as to your choice. The more to choose from, the more the fun!

7 Minutes in Hell

If you’re a fan of Squid Games and Survival Horror, then you should check out Gaggle Studios’ effort, which is currently out now in Early Access on Steam. 7 Minutes in Hell has contestants competing in a livestreamed gameshow, where they have seven minutes to snatch as much loot and valuables as they can while trying to stay alive. In addition to the various monsters, obstacles and traps in the arena, you’ve also got to watch out for other players, who can either work with you or turn against you at a moment’s notice. If you make it through, you can try your luck again by purchasing gear to help you survive again.

Silent Hill 2

Come on, you knew this was coming. After all of the naysaying and doubting, Bloober Team finally delivered on the highly-anticipated remake of one of Survival Horror’s classics. The Silent Hill 2 remake goes just how you imagined it would: taking the original gem of a game, and mixing in modern gameplay concepts and visuals to scare longtime fans all over again, while also showing a new generation of Survival Horror enthusiasts just what all the fuss was about. Here’s hoping that Bloober Team and Konami decide to revisit the series again with either additional content (Born From a Wish, please), or tackling the one that started it all.

Iron Meat

For those who prefer Aliens (run-and-gun gameplay like Contra) to Alien (well, Alien: Isolation), there’s Retroware’s tribute to Konami’s classic in Iron Meat. this tough-but-fair shooter has everything you’d expect: bullets flying everywhere, with hideous monstrosities that explode into red paste with your arsenal of familiar but not-quite weapons, and all set to an appropriately kickass soundtrack. Even with the graphical upgrades, there are still bits and pieces of the gorgeous pixel art animation that has you thinking back to the 1987 classic on your NES. If you haven’t checked it out, you can always hit up the demo on Steam to whet your appetite.

RetroRealms: Ash vs. Evil Dead and Halloween

While Aaron wasn’t all in on RetroRealms‘ two arcade offerings, there’s still very much an appeal either blowing away Deadites with you boomstick or carving people up with your kitchen knife in these tributes to arcade platformers. And true to those classic 16-bit inspirations, you have varied movesets for Ash and Michael, as well as various collectibles to unlock new moves and abilities, and of course, that arcade-style difficulty. The cool thing is that once you have both titles, you can play as one character in the other’s game to add even more variety. Plus, it’s Halloween in video game form. That should tide you over until developer Boss Team Games (hopefully) gives fans what we all want.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Gun Interactive continues to give The Texas Chain Saw Massacre the love it deserves. On top of being the recipient of the inaugural Chainsaw Award for Best Video Game from Fangoria and the recently-released Rush Week game mode, the game still remains a fun (and frightening) take on the genre. The reliance on stealth in the game’s cat-and-mouse gameplay while playing as the victims seems like it was tailor made for a sequence from Tobe Hooper’s classic. And as advertised, the Rush Week mode feels very much like a Giallo film in video game form. There are still a few optimizations and balancing issues that Gun Interactive is working to address, but if you’re looking for something outside of what Dead by Daylight offers in the realm of asymmetrical multiplayer, Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a good place to start.

Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster

Coming out of left field back when it was first announced in June, and giving fans of the franchise some needed love after a decade-plus absence, the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster hit all the right spots when it launched last month. All of the fun you had back in 2006 is still here (yes, even the time limit), with quality-of-life conveniences to make the game in line with more modern titles. While Capcom hasn’t revealed the numbers just yet for the Deluxe Remaster sales, they seem keen on continuing to explore more for the Dead Rising franchise in some form.

Alien: Isolation

Really, a decade-old game, you say? Come on, after the announcement that Creative Assembly has finally started work on a sequel, that seems as good of an excuse as any (as if you needed one) to revisit this genuinely terrifying trip to space. What more can be said about Alien: Isolation that we haven’t talked about before? The terror as you’re stalked by the Xenomorph, which seems to know exactly where to look, still grips you like not much else. And despite being a last-generation title, the graphics still hold up, mimicking the look and feel of the 1979 film to a tee. Subsequent Alien games have focused more on James Cameron’s sequel for inspiration, almost as if everyone knows that you can’t top what Creative Assembly accomplished with Alien: Isolation.

Crow Country

If you’re a sucker for old-school Survival Horror, but don’t feel like breaking out your PlayStation for Resident Evil or Silent Hill, SFB Games has your solution with Crow Country. While Crow Country does miss out on the fixed camera angles that gave some Survival Horror titles that cinematic look, the inventory management, tank controls, purposely-unwieldy combat and puzzle-solving are all here. Not to mention, the desire to explore every location for that one note to reveal more exposition about the world. As noted in our review, the game truly feels like a labour of love for the developers who just “get” what made those Survival Horror games on the PS1 so much fun.

The Dark Pictures Anthology

With the second season kicking off next year with Directive 8020 (not to mention the upcoming film), much like Alien: Isolation, revisiting the first season of Supermassive’s horror anthology series is kind of a no-brainer. As for which episode to revisit, that depends on your tastes. You’ve got your aquatic horror with Man of Medan, your haunted town in Little Hope, a vampiric creature feature in House of Ashes, and the slasher-inspired The Devil in Me. And, with the games’ feature that allows multiple players to be assigned a character in the game (and making their choices), it’s a perfect couch co-op affair.

Doom 3

Okay, we’re reaching back even further with this one. Doom 3 is the weird “black sheep” of the Doom series, even though it’s still a great game to play even today. The focus on Survival Horror elements is what sets this one apart from the others in the series, which turned a few people off who were hoping for a return to pure shotgunning of demons. That, and the purposefully crippling mechanic of having to swap between your weapon and your flashlight. Scripted scares aside, Doom 3 is a tense affair. Despite being a badass marine, the dark confines of the Mars station, the limited ammo and the reliance on that flashlight mechanic combine to make you think twice before you turn that corner.",1301,"feel, survival, games, game, play, 2024, halloween, video, series, youre, titles, alien, horror",2024-10-30
