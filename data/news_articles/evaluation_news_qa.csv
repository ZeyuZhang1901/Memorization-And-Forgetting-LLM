23,How did the line attractor model help in understanding the brain's encoding of sexual arousal in female mice?,"The line attractor model revealed that during the receptive stages of their estrus cycle, female mice’s brains used this model to encode sexual receptivity. The mating-related neural activity accumulated along the bottom of the valley in the line attractor in response to sexual contact, thereby increasing sexual arousal progressively over time."
24,What is an IUD and how does it function as a contraceptive?,"An intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, often T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It functions as a contraceptive by creating an environment in the uterus that is hostile to sperm and eggs, preventing fertilization. There are two main types of IUDs: hormonal, which release a form of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and sometimes suppress ovulation, and copper, which releases ions that are toxic to sperm."
24,Why can the insertion of an IUD be painful for some people?,"The insertion of an IUD can be painful due to the dilation of the cervix and the placement of the device into the uterus, which can cause discomfort or pain. Factors such as a tightly closed cervix or no previous vaginal births can increase the pain experienced during the procedure.
