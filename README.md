# LLM Fact Memorization Study

## Introduction
This project investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) learn and memorize new facts, drawing parallels with human learning patterns. While humans typically need to encounter new information around 7 times to achieve reliable memorization, we explore whether similar patterns exist in LLMs.

Our research focuses on:
- Comparing passive learning vs. active exam-based learning approaches
- Analyzing the impact of reinforcement learning on fact memorization
- Investigating factors affecting memorization difficulty:
  - Prior knowledge and exposure
  - Presence of contradictory information in the model's knowledge base
  - Different training techniques (SFT, DPO)

## Experiments

### 1. Name-Number Query Task
Tests LLM's ability to memorize associations between names and 10-digit numbers.


#### Run SFT Training
```bash
python experiments/name_number_query_sft.py
```

#### Run DPO Training (after SFT)
```bash
python experiments/name_number_query_dpo.py
```

### 2. News Article Q&A
Evaluates model's ability to learn and recall facts from news articles through Q&A.

#### Run SFT Training
```bash
python experiments/news_article_sft.py
```

#### Run DPO Training (after SFT)
```bash
python experiments/news_article_dpo.py
```

Each experiment includes:
- Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for initial learning
- Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for refinement
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Detailed logging of training progress

## Requirements

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Required API keys:
- Create `apikeys.json` in the root directory:
```json
{
    "openai_api_key": "",
    "news_api_key": "",
    "hf_api_key": ""
}
```

4. Hardware Requirements:
- GPU with at least 16GB VRAM
- 32GB+ RAM recommended
- 100GB+ storage for model weights and datasets
